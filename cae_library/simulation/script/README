**The TCL script requires FOUNDRY variable to be set. If not, please set it to:
<diamond_path>/ispfpga

**Supported TCL version is 8.5 or higher.

If you don't have TCL installed, or you have an older version, please do the following:
- add <diamond_path>/tcltk/bin to the front of your PATH, and
- for Linux users only, add <diamond_path>/tcltk/lib to the front of your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

NOTE: Default version on Linux could be older and may cause the script to fail.
To check TCL version, type:
tclsh
% info tclversion
% exit

**For script Usage, type:
tclsh cmpl_libs.tcl [-h|-help|]

NOTE: If Modelsim/Questa is already in your PATH and preceding any Aldec tools, you can use:
'-sim_path .' for simplification; '.' will be added to the front of your PATH.

**Check log files under <target_path> (defualt = .) for any errors:
- linux: grep -i error *.log
- windows: find /i "error" *.log
