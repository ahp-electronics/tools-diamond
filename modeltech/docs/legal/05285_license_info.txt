    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007
    
     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    
      This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
    the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
    License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
    
      0. Additional Definitions. 
    
      As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
    General Public License.
    
      "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
    other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
    
      An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
    by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
    Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
    of using an interface provided by the Library.
    
      A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
    Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
    with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
    Version".
    
      The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
    Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
    for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
    based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
    
      The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
    object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
    and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
    Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
    
      1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
    
      You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
    without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
    
      2. Conveying Modified Versions.
    
      If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
    facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
    that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
    facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
    version:
    
       a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
       ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
       function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
       whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
    
       b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
       this License applicable to that copy.
    
      3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
    
      The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
    a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
    code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
    material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
    layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
    (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
    
       a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
       covered by this License.
    
       b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
       document.
    
      4. Combined Works.
    
      You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
    taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
    portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
    the following:
    
       a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
       the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
       covered by this License.
    
       b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
       document.
    
       c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
       execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
       these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
       copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
    
       d) Do one of the following:
    
           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
           License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
           suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
           recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
           the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
           manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
           Corresponding Source.
    
           1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
           Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
           a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
           system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
           of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
           Version. 
    
       e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
       be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
       GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
       necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
       Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
       Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
       you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
       the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
       Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
       Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
       for conveying Corresponding Source.)
    
      5. Combined Libraries.
    
      You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side by side in a single library together with other library
    facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
    License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
    choice, if you do both of the following:
    
       a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
       on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
       conveyed under the terms of this License.
    
       b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
       is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
       accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
      6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
    
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
    Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
    of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
    applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that published version or of any later version
    published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
    received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
    
      If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
    whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
    apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
    permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
    Library.

License #2, GPL 3.0.

    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    Version 3, 29 June 2007
    
     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
      Preamble
    
      The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
    software and other kinds of works.
    
      The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
    to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
    software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
    any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
    freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
    or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.
    
      Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
    
      For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
    authors of previous versions.
    
      Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
    
      Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
      0. Definitions.
    
      "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
    
      "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
    works, such as semiconductor masks.
    
      "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
    "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
    
      To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
    exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
    earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
    
      A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.
    
      To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
    computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
    public, and in some countries other activities as well.
    
      To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
    
      An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
    
      1. Source Code.
    
      The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
    form of a work.
    
      A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
    is widely used among developers working in that language.
    
      The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
    implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
    "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
    
      The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
    which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
    subprograms and other parts of the work.
    
      The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
    Source.
    
      The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
    same work.
    
      2. Basic Permissions.
    
      All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
    conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
    content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
    
      You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
    in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
    not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
    
      Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
    the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
    makes it unnecessary.
    
      3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
    
      No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
    measures.
    
      When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
    technological measures.
    
      4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
    
      You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
    keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
    recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
    
      You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
    and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
    
      5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
    
      You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
    produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
    terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
        it, and giving a relevant date.
    
        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
        released under this License and any conditions added under section
        7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
        "keep intact all notices".
    
        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
        License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
        License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
        additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
        regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
        invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    
        d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
        interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
        work need not make them do so.
    
      A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
    works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
    and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
    in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
    "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
    used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
    beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
    in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
    parts of the aggregate.
    
      6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
    
      You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
    machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
    in one of these ways:
    
        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
        customarily used for software interchange.
    
        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
        written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
        long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
        model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
        copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
        product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
        medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
        more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
        conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
        Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    
        c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
        written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
        alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
        only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
        with subsection 6b.
    
        d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
        place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
        Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
        further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
        Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
        copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
        may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
        that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
        clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
        Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
        Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
        available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    
        e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
        you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
        Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
        charge under subsection 6d.
    
      A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
    from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
    included in conveying the object code work.
    
      A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
    or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
    into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
    product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
    typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
    of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
    actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
    is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
    commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
    the only significant mode of use of the product.
    
      "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
    a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
    suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
    code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
    modification has been made.
    
      If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
    part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
    User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
    fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
    Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
    by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
    if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
    modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
    been installed in ROM).
    
      The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
    for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
    network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
    protocols for communication across the network.
    
      Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
    in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
    documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
    source code form), and must require no special password or key for
    unpacking, reading or copying.
    
      7. Additional Terms.
    
      "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
    be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
    that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
    apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
    under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
    this License without regard to the additional permissions.
    
      When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
    it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
    removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
    additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
    for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
    
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
    add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
    that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
    
        a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
        terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    
        b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
        author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
        Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    
        c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
        requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
        reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    
        d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
        authors of the material; or
    
        e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
        trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    
        f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
        material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
        it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
        any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
        those licensors and authors.
    
      All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
    restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
    governed by this License along with a term that is a further
    restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
    a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
    License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
    of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
    not survive such relicensing or conveying.
    
      If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
    must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
    additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
    where to find the applicable terms.
    
      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
    form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
    the above requirements apply either way.
    
      8. Termination.
    
      You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
    provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
    modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
    this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
    paragraph of section 11).
    
      However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
    prior to 60 days after the cessation.
    
      Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
    your receipt of the notice.
    
      Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
    material under section 10.
    
      9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
    
      You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
    run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
    occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
    to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
    nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
    modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
    not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
    covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
    
      10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
    
      Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
    propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
    for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
    
      An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
    work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
    transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
    licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
    give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
    Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
    the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
    
      You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
    rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
    not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
    rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
    sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
    
      11. Patents.
    
      A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
    License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
    work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
    
      A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
    by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
    consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
    purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
    patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
    this License.
    
      Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
    patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
    make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
    propagate the contents of its contributor version.
    
      In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
    (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
    sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
    party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
    patent against the party.
    
      If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
    to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
    publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
    then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
    available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
    license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
    covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
    in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
    country that you have reason to believe are valid.
    
      If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
    covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
    receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
    or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
    you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
    work and works based on it.
    
      A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
    work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
    in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
    to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
    the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
    parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
    conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
    or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
    
      Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
    any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
    otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
    
      12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
    
      If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
    
      13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
    
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
    permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
    under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
    combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
    License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
    but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
    combination as such.
    
      14. Revised Versions of this License.
    
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
    the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
    Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
    option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
    version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
    GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
    by the Free Software Foundation.
    
      If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
    versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
    public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
    to choose that version for the Program.
    
      Later license versions may give you additional or different
    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
    author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
    later version.
    
      15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    
      THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
    THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
    IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. Limitation of Liability.
    
      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.
    
      17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
    
      If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
    an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
    Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
    copy of the Program in return for a fee.
    
                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    
        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
      If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
    notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
    might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
    
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
    if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
    For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
    <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
    
      The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
    the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
    Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
    <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

License #3, GPL.

    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    Version 3, 29 June 2007
    
     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
      Preamble
    
      The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
    software and other kinds of works.
    
      The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
    to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
    software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
    any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
    freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
    or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.
    
      Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
    
      For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
    authors of previous versions.
    
      Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
    
      Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
                           TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
      0. Definitions.
    
      "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
    
      "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
    works, such as semiconductor masks.
    
      "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
    "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
    
      To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
    exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
    earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
    
      A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.
    
      To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
    computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
    public, and in some countries other activities as well.
    
      To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
    
      An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
    
      1. Source Code.
    
      The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
    form of a work.
    
      A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
    is widely used among developers working in that language.
    
      The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
    implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
    "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
    
      The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
    which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
    subprograms and other parts of the work.
    
      The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
    Source.
    
      The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
    same work.
    
      2. Basic Permissions.
    
      All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
    conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
    content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
    
      You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
    in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
    not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
    
      Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
    the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
    makes it unnecessary.
    
      3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
    
      No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
    measures.
    
      When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
    technological measures.
    
      4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
    
      You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
    keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
    recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
    
      You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
    and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
    
      5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
    
      You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
    produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
    terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
        it, and giving a relevant date.
    
        b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
        released under this License and any conditions added under section
        7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
        "keep intact all notices".
    
        c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
        License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
        License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
        additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
        regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
        invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    
        d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
        interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
        work need not make them do so.
    
      A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
    works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
    and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
    in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
    "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
    used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
    beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
    in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
    parts of the aggregate.
    
      6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
    
      You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
    machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
    in one of these ways:
    
        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
        customarily used for software interchange.
    
        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
        written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
        long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
        model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
        copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
        product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
        medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
        more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
        conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
        Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    
        c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
        written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
        alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
        only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
        with subsection 6b.
    
        d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
        place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
        Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
        further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
        Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
        copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
        may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
        that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
        clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
        Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
        Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
        available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    
        e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
        you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
        Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
        charge under subsection 6d.
    
      A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
    from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
    included in conveying the object code work.
    
      A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
    or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
    into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
    product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
    typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
    of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
    actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
    is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
    commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
    the only significant mode of use of the product.
    
      "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
    a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
    suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
    code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
    modification has been made.
    
      If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
    part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
    User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
    fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
    Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
    by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
    if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
    modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
    been installed in ROM).
    
      The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
    for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
    network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
    protocols for communication across the network.
    
      Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
    in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
    documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
    source code form), and must require no special password or key for
    unpacking, reading or copying.
    
      7. Additional Terms.
    
      "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
    be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
    that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
    apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
    under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
    this License without regard to the additional permissions.
    
      When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
    it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
    removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
    additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
    for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
    
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
    add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
    that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
    
        a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
        terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    
        b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
        author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
        Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    
        c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
        requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
        reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
    
        d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
        authors of the material; or
    
        e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
        trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    
        f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
        material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
        it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
        any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
        those licensors and authors.
    
      All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
    restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
    governed by this License along with a term that is a further
    restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
    a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
    License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
    of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
    not survive such relicensing or conveying.
    
      If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
    must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
    additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
    where to find the applicable terms.
    
      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
    form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
    the above requirements apply either way.
    
      8. Termination.
    
      You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
    provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
    modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
    this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
    paragraph of section 11).
    
      However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
    prior to 60 days after the cessation.
    
      Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
    your receipt of the notice.
    
      Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
    material under section 10.
    
      9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
    
      You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
    run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
    occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
    to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
    nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
    modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
    not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
    covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
    
      10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
    
      Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
    propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
    for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
    
      An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
    work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
    transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
    licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
    give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
    Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
    the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
    
      You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
    rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
    not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
    rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
    sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
    
      11. Patents.
    
      A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
    License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
    work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
    
      A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
    by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
    consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
    purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
    patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
    this License.
    
      Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
    patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
    make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
    propagate the contents of its contributor version.
    
      In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
    (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
    sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
    party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
    patent against the party.
    
      If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
    to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
    publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
    then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
    available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
    license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
    covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
    in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
    country that you have reason to believe are valid.
    
      If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
    covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
    receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
    or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
    you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
    work and works based on it.
    
      A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
    work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
    in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
    to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
    the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
    parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
    conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
    or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
    
      Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
    any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
    otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
    
      12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
    
      If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
    
      13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
    
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
    permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
    under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
    combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
    License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
    but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
    combination as such.
    
      14. Revised Versions of this License.
    
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
    the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
    Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
    option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
    version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
    GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
    by the Free Software Foundation.
    
      If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
    versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
    public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
    to choose that version for the Program.
    
      Later license versions may give you additional or different
    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
    author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
    later version.
    
      15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
    
      THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
    THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
    IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. Limitation of Liability.
    
      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.
    
      17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
    
      If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
    an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
    Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
    copy of the Program in return for a fee.
    
                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    
        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
      If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
    notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
    might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
    
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
    if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
    For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
    <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
    
      The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
    may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
    the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
    Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
    <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

     numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
      This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
    other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
    your libraries, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
    you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
    with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
      Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
    the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
      Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
    version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
    the original authors' reputations.
    
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
    software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
    transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
    we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
    free use or not licensed at all.
    
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
    GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
    license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
    designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
    one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
    the same as in the ordinary license.
    
      The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
    they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
    program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
    changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
    analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
    a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
    derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
    treats it as such.
    
      Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
    Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
    sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
    concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
    
      However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
    users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
    libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
    permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
    preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
    libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
    this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
    changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
    will lead to faster development of free libraries.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
    former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
    works together with the library.
    
      Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
    General Public License rather than by this special one.
    
    
    		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
    party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
    General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
    addressed as "you".
    
      A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    
      "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the library.
    
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.
      
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.
    
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.
    
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    
        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    
        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.
    
        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
    
    
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.
    
      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.
    
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    
      However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    
      When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    
    
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.
    
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:
    
        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)
    
        b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.
    
        c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.
    
        d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.
    
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.
    
    
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    
        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.
    
        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.
    
      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
    
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
    
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    
               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).
    
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    
        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
        version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
        Library General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

    Version 3.0, 18 August 2009
    
    Copyright © 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
    
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    This Exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
    
    The purpose of this Exception is to allow distribution of Autoconf's typical output under terms of the recipient's choice (including proprietary).
    
    0. Definitions.
    "Covered Code" is the source or object code of a version of Autoconf that is a covered work under this License.
    
    "Normally Copied Code" for a version of Autoconf means all parts of its Covered Code which that version can copy from its code (i.e., not from its input file) into its minimally verbose, non-debugging and non-tracing output.
    
    "Ineligible Code" is Covered Code that is not Normally Copied Code.
    
    1. Grant of Additional Permission.
    You have permission to propagate output of Autoconf, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3. However, if by modifying Autoconf you cause any Ineligible Code of the version you received to become Normally Copied Code of your modified version, then you void this Exception for the resulting covered work. If you convey that resulting covered work, you must remove this Exception in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 7 of GPLv3.
    
    2. No Weakening of Autoconf Copyleft.
    The availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of Autoconf.

    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    Version 2, June 1991
    
    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
     Preamble
    
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.
    
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
    
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
    
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
    
    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    
      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
    
    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
    
    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
    
    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
    
    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    NO WARRANTY
    
    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.
    
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    
    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989   Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

         <http://fsf.org/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    0. PREAMBLE
    
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document ""free"" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
    for modifications made by others.
    
    This License is a kind of ""copyleft"", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
    
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    
    
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
    
    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
    work under the conditions stated herein.  The ""Document"", below,
    refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
    licensee, and is addressed as ""you"".  You accept the license if you
    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
    under copyright law.
    
    A ""Modified Version"" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
    
    A ""Secondary Section"" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
    the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
    part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
    any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.
    
    The ""Invariant Sections"" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
    allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
    Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
    Sections then there are none.
    
    The ""Cover Texts"" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
    the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
    
    A ""Transparent"" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
    to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
    format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
    or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
    An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
    of text.  A copy that is not ""Transparent"" is called ""Opaque"".
    
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
    HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
    transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
    include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
    proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.
    
    The ""Title Page"" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, ""Title Page"" means
    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    
    The ""publisher"" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
    the Document to the public.
    
    A section ""Entitled XYZ"" means a named subunit of the Document whose
    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
    text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
    specific section name mentioned below, such as ""Acknowledgements"",
    ""Dedications"", ""Endorsements"", or ""History"".)  To ""Preserve the Title""
    of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
    section ""Entitled XYZ"" according to this definition.
    
    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
    states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
    License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
    implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
    no effect on the meaning of this License.
    
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
    
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
    other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
    copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
    you may publicly display copies.
    
    
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    
    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
    the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
    you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
    as verbatim copying in other respects.
    
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.
    
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
    a computer-network location from which the general network-using
    public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
    a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
    If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
    when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
    that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
    Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
    edition to the public.
    
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
    Document.
    
    
    4. MODIFICATIONS
    
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
    of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
       Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
       unless they release you from this requirement.
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
       Modified Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
       and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section Entitled ""History"", Preserve its Title, and add
       to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
       there is no section Entitled ""History"" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on.  These may be placed in the ""History"" section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. For any section Entitled ""Acknowledgements"" or ""Dedications"",
       Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
       the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
       unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
       or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section Entitled ""Endorsements"".  Such a section
       may not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ""Endorsements""
       or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
    
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
    of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    
    You may add a section Entitled ""Endorsements"", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
    
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
    
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
    
    
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
    
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
    license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
    
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
    copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    
    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ""History""
    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
    ""History""; likewise combine any sections Entitled ""Acknowledgements"",
    and any sections Entitled ""Dedications"".  You must delete all sections
    Entitled ""Endorsements"".
    
    
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
    
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
    documents released under this License, and replace the individual
    copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
    that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
    of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
    other respects.
    
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
    distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
    copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
    License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
    document.
    
    
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an ""aggregate"" if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
    of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
    When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
    apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.
    
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
    the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
    covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
    electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
    Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
    aggregate.
    
    
    8. TRANSLATION
    
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
    original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
    translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
    Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
    the original English version of this License and the original versions
    of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
    the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
    or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
    
    If a section in the Document is Entitled ""Acknowledgements"",
    ""Dedications"", or ""History"", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
    its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
    title.
    
    
    9. TERMINATION
    
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
    will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    
    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
    unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
    terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
    fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
    60 days after the cessation.
    
    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
    your receipt of the notice.
    
    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
    not give you any rights to use it.
    
    
    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
    
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
    GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
    detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
    
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
    License ""or any later version"" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
    as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
    specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
    License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
    version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
    Document.
    
    11. RELICENSING
    
    ""Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site"" (or ""MMC Site"") means any
    World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
    provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
    public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
    ""Massive Multiauthor Collaboration"" (or ""MMC"") contained in the site
    means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
    
    ""CC-BY-SA"" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
    license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
    California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
    published by that same organization.
    
    ""Incorporate"" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
    part, as part of another Document.
    
    An MMC is ""eligible for relicensing"" if it is licensed under this 
    License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
    somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
    in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
    (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
    
    The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
    under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
    provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
    
    
    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
    
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
    the License in the document and put the following copyright and
    license notices just after the title page:
    
        Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
        Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
        under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
        or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
        with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
        A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ""GNU
        Free Documentation License"".
    
    If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
    replace the ""with...Texts."" line with this:
    
        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
    
    If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
    combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
    situation.
    
    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
    free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
    to permit their use in free software.

License #20, GFDL 1.1.

    GNU Free Documentation License
    		   Version 1.1, March 2000
    
     Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
     
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    0. PREAMBLE
    
    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
    the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
    modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
    this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
    credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
    modifications made by others.
    
    This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.
    
    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
    
    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
    
    This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
    under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
    such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
    addressed as "you".
    
    A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.
    
    A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
    the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.
    
    The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License.
    
    The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
    the Document is released under this License.
    
    A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
    to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
    format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
    subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
    not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    
    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
    HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
    PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
    by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
    purposes only.
    
    The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
    
    
    2. VERBATIM COPYING
    
    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
    copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
    
    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
    you may publicly display copies.
    
    
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
    
    If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
    and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
    the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
    the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
    you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
    as verbatim copying in other respects.
    
    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.
    
    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
    a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
    general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
    option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
    Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
    until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
    copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
    the public.
    
    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
    them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
    
    
    4. MODIFICATIONS
    
    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
    of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
    
    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
       Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
       Modified Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
       and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
       unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
       or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
       may not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
       or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    
    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
    of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
    
    You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.
    
    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
    
    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
    
    
    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
    
    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
    license notice.
    
    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
    copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
    
    In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
    "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
    and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
    entitled "Endorsements."
    
    
    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
    
    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
    released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
    License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
    the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
    verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
    
    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
    it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
    License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
    other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
    
    
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
    
    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
    of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
    compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
    License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
    with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
    are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
    
    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
    of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
    covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
    Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
    
    
    8. TRANSLATION
    
    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
    original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
    translation of this License provided that you also include the
    original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
    between the translation and the original English version of this
    License, the original English version will prevail.
    
    
    9. TERMINATION
    
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
    as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
    copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
    automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
    parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
    
    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
    
    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
    of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
    
    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
    License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
    as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
    
    
    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
    
    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
    the License in the document and put the following copyright and
    license notices just after the title page:
    
          Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
          Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
          under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
          or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
          with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
          Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
          A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
          Free Documentation License".
    
    If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
    instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
    Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
    "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
    
    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
    free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
    to permit their use in free software.

             3. The name of the Author may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from the Work without the prior written consent of the Author.
             4. You agree not to sell, lease, or rent any part of the Work. This does not restrict you from including the Work or any part of the Work inside a larger software distribution that itself is being sold. The Work by itself, though, cannot be sold, leased or rented.
             5. You may distribute the Executable Files and Source Code only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy of the Executable Files or Source Code You distribute and ensure that anyone receiving such Executable Files and Source Code agrees that the terms of this License apply to such Executable Files and/or Source Code.

       6. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer. THIS WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", "WHERE IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR GUARANTEES. YOU, THE USER, ASSUME ALL RISK IN ITS USE, INCLUDING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, SUITABILITY, ETC. AUTHOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT THE WORK (OR ANY PORTION THEREOF) IS CORRECT, USEFUL, BUG-FREE OR FREE OF VIRUSES. YOU MUST PASS THIS DISCLAIMER ON WHENEVER YOU DISTRIBUTE THE WORK OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.
       7. Indemnity. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Author and the Publisher from and against any claims, suits, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal or attorneys’ fees) resulting from or relating to any use of the Work by You.
       8. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AUTHOR OR THE PUBLISHER BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE AUTHOR OR THE PUBLISHER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
       9. Termination.
             1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of any term of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 will survive any termination of this License.
             2. If You bring a copyright, trademark, patent or any other infringement claim against any contributor over infringements You claim are made by the Work, your License from such contributor to the Work ends automatically.
             3. Subject to the above terms and conditions, this License is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, the Author reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
      10. Publisher. The parties hereby confirm that the Publisher shall not, under any circumstances, be responsible for and shall not have any liability in respect of the subject matter of this License. The Publisher makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work and shall not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. The Publisher reserves the right to cease making the Work available to You at any time without notice
      11. Miscellaneous
             1. This License shall be governed by the laws of the location of the head office of the Author or if the Author is an individual, the laws of location of the principal place of residence of the Author.
             2. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this License, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
             3. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
             4. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed herein. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified herein. The Author shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Author and You.

    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007
    
     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    
      This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
    the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
    License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
    
      0. Additional Definitions. 
    
      As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
    General Public License.
    
      "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
    other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
    
      An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
    by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
    Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
    of using an interface provided by the Library.
    
      A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
    Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
    with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
    Version".
    
      The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
    Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
    for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
    based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
    
      The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
    object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
    and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
    Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
    
      1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
    
      You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
    without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
    
      2. Conveying Modified Versions.
    
      If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
    facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
    that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
    facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
    version:
    
       a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
       ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
       function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
       whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
    
       b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
       this License applicable to that copy.
    
      3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
    
      The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
    a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
    code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
    material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
    layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
    (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
    
       a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
       covered by this License.
    
       b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
       document.
    
      4. Combined Works.
    
      You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
    taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
    portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
    the following:
    
       a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
       the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
       covered by this License.
    
       b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
       document.
    
       c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
       execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
       these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
       copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
    
       d) Do one of the following:
    
           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
           License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
           suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
           recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
           the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
           manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
           Corresponding Source.
    
           1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
           Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
           a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
           system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
           of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
           Version. 
    
       e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
       be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
       GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
       necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
       Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
       Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
       you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
       the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
       Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
       Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
       for conveying Corresponding Source.)
    
      5. Combined Libraries.
    
      You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side by side in a single library together with other library
    facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
    License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
    choice, if you do both of the following:
    
       a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
       on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
       conveyed under the terms of this License.
    
       b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
       is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
       accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
      6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
    
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
    Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
    of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
    applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that published version or of any later version
    published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
    received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
    
      If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
    whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
    apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
    permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
    Library.

    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 2.1, February 1999
    
     Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
     the version number 2.1.]
    
                                Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
    
      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
    these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    
      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    
      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
    introduced by others.
    
    
      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
    
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
    libraries into non-free programs.
    
      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
    the library.
    
      We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
    special circumstances.
    
      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
    
      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
    system.
    
      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
    that program using a modified version of the Library.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
    "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
    be combined with the library in order to run.
    
    
                      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
      A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    
      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    
      "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
    and installation of the library.
    
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
    and what the program that uses the Library does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
    Library.
    
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.
    
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    
        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    
        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
        in the event an application does not supply such function or
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
        its purpose remains meaningful.
    
        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
        application-supplied function or table used by this function must
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
        root function must still compute square roots.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
    these notices.
    
    
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
    the Library into a program that is not a library.
    
      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
    medium customarily used for software interchange.
    
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    
      However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
    
      When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
    Library will still fall under Section 6.)
    
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    
    
      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
    engineering for debugging such modifications.
    
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
    of these things:
    
        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
        uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
        to use the modified definitions.)
    
        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    
        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
        least three years, to give the same user the materials
        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
        than the cost of performing this distribution.
    
        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
        specified materials from the same place.
    
        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
    
      For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
    the executable.
    
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
    distribute.
    
    
      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    
        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
        Sections above.
    
        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
    
      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    
      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Library or works based on it.
    
      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
    this License.
    
    
      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
    written in the body of this License.
    
      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.
    
    
      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.
    
                                NO WARRANTY
    
      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
    
                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    
               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
    
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
    ordinary General Public License).
    
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    
        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
        modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
        version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
        Lesser General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
      library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

    The first argument passed to this file is the canonical host specification,
       CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM
    or
       CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-KERNEL-OPERATING_SYSTEM
    The environment variables CC, GCC, LDFLAGS, LD, with_gnu_ld
    should be set by the caller.
    The set of defined variables is at the end of this script.
    Known limitations:
    - On IRIX 6.5 with CC="cc", the run time search patch must not be longer
      than 256 bytes, otherwise the compiler driver will dump core. The only
      known workaround is to choose shorter directory names for the build
      directory and/or the installation directory.
    All known linkers require a `.a' archive for static linking (except M$VC,
    which needs '.lib').

    This awk script hacks the output of mig-generated reply server code
    so that it allows replies with just the error-code in them (as this is

    This program requires gdb and objcopy in addition to gcc.
    The default values are gdb from the build tree and objcopy from $PATH.
    They may be overridden by setting environment variables GDB and OBJCOPY
    respectively.  Note that GDB should contain the gdb binary as well as the
    -data-directory flag, e.g., "foo/gdb -data-directory foo/data-directory".
    We assume the current directory is either $obj/gdb or $obj/gdb/testsuite.
    Example usage:
    bash$ cd $objdir/gdb/testsuite
    bash$ runtest \
      CC_FOR_TARGET="/bin/sh $srcdir/gdb/contrib/cc-with-tweaks.sh ARGS gcc" \
      CXX_FOR_TARGET="/bin/sh $srcdir/gdb/contrib/cc-with-tweaks.sh ARGS g++"
    For documentation on Fission and dwp files:
        http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission
        http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFissionDWP
    For documentation on index files: info -f gdb.info -n "Index Files"
    For information about 'dwz', see the announcement:
        http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2012-04/msg00686.html
    (More documentation is to come.)
    ARGS determine what is done.  They can be:
    -Z invoke objcopy --compress-debug-sections
    -z compress using dwz
    -m compress using dwz -m
    -i make an index
    -p create .dwp files (Fission), you need to also use gcc option -gsplit-dwarf
    If nothing is given, no changes are made

    This is a GCC plugin that computes some exception-handling data for
    gdb.  This data can then be summarized and checked by the
    exsummary.py script.
    To use:
    * First, install the GCC Python plugin.  See
      https://fedorahosted.org/gcc-python-plugin/
    * export PYTHON_PLUGIN=/full/path/to/plugin/directory
      This should be the directory holding "python.so".
    * cd build/gdb; make mostlyclean
    * make CC=.../gcc-with-excheck
      This will write a number of .py files in the build directory.
    * python .../exsummary.py
      This will show the violations.

    /* Before including this file, you need to include <config.h> and

         RESULT_TYPE             A macro that expands to the return type.
         AVAILABLE(h, h_l, j, n_l)
                                 A macro that returns nonzero if there are
                                 at least N_L bytes left starting at H[J].
                                 H is 'unsigned char *', H_L, J, and N_L
                                 are 'size_t'; H_L is an lvalue.  For
                                 NUL-terminated searches, H_L can be
                                 modified each iteration to avoid having

      For case-insensitivity, you may optionally define:
         CMP_FUNC(p1, p2, l)     A macro that returns 0 iff the first L
                                 characters of P1 and P2 are equal.
         CANON_ELEMENT(c)        A macro that canonicalizes an element right after
                                 it has been fetched from one of the two strings.
                                 The argument is an 'unsigned char'; the result
                                 must be an 'unsigned char' as well.
      This file undefines the macros documented above, and defines
      LONG_NEEDLE_THRESHOLD.

    The table consists of lines of the form
       ALIAS  CANONICAL
    ALIAS is the (system dependent) result of "nl_langinfo (CODESET)".
    ALIAS is compared in a case sensitive way.
    CANONICAL is the GNU canonical name for this character encoding.
    It must be an encoding supported by libiconv. Support by GNU libc is
    also desirable. CANONICAL is case insensitive. Usually an upper case
    MIME charset name is preferred.
    The current list of GNU canonical charset names is as follows.

    %   Modifications made in order to handle different papersizes correctly.
    %   You only have to set the total width and height of the paper, the
    %   horizontal and vertical margin space measured from *paper edge*
    %   and the interline and interspec spacing.
    %   In order to support a new papersize, you have to fiddle with the
    %   latter four dimensions. Just try out a few values.
    %   All other values will be computed at process time so it should be
    %   quite easy to support different paper sizes - only four values to
    %   guess :-)
    %
    %   To find the configuration places, just search for the string
    %   "CONFIGURATION".

    % Uncomment the following `magnification' command if you want to print
    % out in a larger font.  Caution!  You may need larger paper.  You had
    % best avoid using 3-column output if you try this.  See the ``Three
    % column format'' section below if you want to print in three column
    % format.

    This file tests MI thread commands.
    Specifically, we are testing the MI command set and the console (in MI)
    command set ("interpreter-exec") and that the commands that are executed
    via these command pathways are properly executed. Console commands
    executed via MI should use MI output wrappers, MI event handlers, etc.

    This file tests that GDB's console can be accessed via the MI.
    Specifically, we are testing the "interpreter-exec" command and that
    the commands that are executed via this command are properly executed.
    Console commands executed via MI should use MI output wrappers, MI event
    handlers, etc.

    On decr_pc_after_break targets, GDB used to adjust the PC
    incorrectly if a background single-step stopped somewhere where
    PC-$decr_pc had a breakpoint, and the thread was not the current
    thread, like:
      ADDR1 nop <-- breakpoint here
      ADDR2 jmp PC
     IOW, say thread A is stepping ADDR2's line in the background (an
     infinite loop), and the user switches focus to thread B.  GDB's
     adjust_pc_after_break logic would confuse the single-step stop of
     thread A for a hit of the breakpoint at ADDR1, and thus adjust
     thread A's PC to point at ADDR1 when it should not: the thread had
     been single-stepped, not continued.

    would leave child fork threads stuck stopped, even though "info

    On GNU/Linux, a creating a thread bound to an unexisting cpu spawns
    the clone child thread for a bit, which is then immediately
    cancelled.  The spawned child may trigger a dlopen (for libgcc_s)
    while being cancelled, which results in a trap being reported to
    GDB, for a thread that libthread_db considers to be TD_THR_ZOMBIE.
    Make sure we handle that scenario properly.

    It tests that the correct thread is single-stepped.  Prior to the
    introduction of vCont, we didn't pass enough information to remote
    multi-threaded stubs to reliably get this correct; gdbserver defaulted
    to the first thread.
    TODO: we should also test explicitly changing threads with the "thread"
    command.

       Do not use threads as we need to exploit a bug in LWP code masked by the
       threads code otherwise.
       INFERIOR_PTID must point to exited LWP.  Here we use the initial LWP as it
       is automatically INFERIOR_PTID for GDB.
       Finally we need to call target_resume (RESUME_ALL, ...) which we invoke by
       NEW_THREAD_EVENT (called from the new LWP as initial LWP is exited now).

    It tests printing of thread event (start, exit) information, and
    disabling of those messages.
    Note: the format of thread event messages (and also whether or not
    messages are printed and can be disabled) is dependent on the target
    thread support code.
    This test has only been verified with Linux targets, and would need
    to be generalized to support other targets

    x86 and amd64 gdbserver had a bug where a watchpoint triggered by
    the DR3 debug register would trip on a bogus assertion.
    This test relies on being able to set 4 hardware watchpoints.  Since
    that is not a valid assumption across most targets, and we're
    testing a x86 specific bug, skip everywhere else.

    In this test we're looking at how gdb handles backtraces and
    investigating the stack depth when confronted with an "invalid" stack,
    that is a stack where the first few frames are normal, and then there's a
    frame where the stack in unreadable.
    One interesting bug that has been observed is that gdb will sometime
    exhibit different behaviour the first time a stack command is run
    compared to the second (and later) times a command is run.  This is
    because the first time a command is run gdb actually tries to figure out
    the answer, while the second (and later) times gdb relies on the answer
    cached from the first time.  As a result in this test each command is
    run twice, and we restart gdb before testing each different command to
    ensure that nothing is being cached.

    Note: This test is essentially a transcription of gdb.cp/formatted-ref.exp,
    and is thus much more wordy than it needs to be. There are fewer
    tests because only a few parameter types in Ada are required to be
    passed by reference, and there is no equivalent of &(&x) for reference
    values.
    This also tests that some other arithmetic operations on references
    work properly: condition expression using a reference object as one of its
    operand.

    The program siginfo-addr.c arranges for a signal handler registered
    using sigaction's sa_sigaction / SA_SIGINFO to be called with
    si_addr filled in.
    This test confirms that the si_addr value is correct rather than
    having been corrupted when GDB passed the signal on to the handler.

    The purpose of this testcase is to verify that we can "next" over
    a call to a function provided by one shared library made from another
    shared library, and that GDB stops at the expected location. In this
    case, the call is made from sub1 (provided by libdso1) and we are
    calling sub2 (provided by libdso2).
    Note that, while this is not the main purpose of this testcase, it
    also happens to exercise an issue with displaced stepping on amd64
    when libdso1 is mapped at an address greater than 0xffffffff.

    The doco makes reference to built-in registers -- $pc and $fp.  If
    the ISA contains registers by that name then they should be
    displayed.  If the ISA contains registers identified as being
    equivalent, but have different names, then GDB will provide these as
    aliases.  If the ISA doesn't provide any equivalent registers, then
    GDB will provide registers that map onto the frame's PC and FP.

    Check that GDB can trigger and backtrace SIGSEGV signal stacks
    caused by both accessing (data) and executing (code) at address
    zero.
    On function descriptor architectures, a zero descriptor, instead of
    a NULL pointer, is used.  That way the NULL code test always
    contains a zero code reference.
    For recovery, sigjmp/longjmp are used.
    This also tests backtrace/gdb1476.

    The program sigaltstack.c creates a backtrace containing nested
    signal handlers on an alternative stack.  This in turn leads to a
    non-contiguous (and possibly non-monotonic) backtrace - stack
    address jump at the normal-alt stack boundary.
    This test confirms that GDB can both backtrace through and finish
    such a stack.

    This test case verifies that if a display is active on a variable
    which belongs in a shared library, and that shared library is
    reloaded (e.g. due to re-execution of the program), GDB will continue
    to display it (gdb-6.8 crashed under this scenario).
    Also test that a display of variable which is currently present in
    a shared library, but disappears before re-run, doesn't cause GDB
    difficulties, and that it continues to display other variables.
    Finally, test that displays which refer to main executable
    (and thus aren't affected by shared library unloading) are not
    disabled prematurely.

    The program sigstep.c creates a very simple backtrace containing one
    signal handler and signal trampoline.  A flag is set and then the
    handler returns.  This is repeated at infinitum.
    This test runs the program up to the signal handler, and then
    attempts to step/next out of the handler and back into main.

    The program siginfo.c creates a backtrace containing a signal
    handler registered using sigaction's sa_sigaction / SA_SIGINFO.
    Some OS's (e.g., GNU/Linux) use different signal trampolines for
    sa_sigaction and sa_handler.
    This test first confirms that GDB can backtrace through the
    alternative sa_sigaction signal handler, and second that GDB can
    nexti/stepi out of such a handler.

    This is a regression test for the following bug, as of 2003-12-12:
    Set a breakpoint which will be hit many times.  Attach a complex set
    of commands to it, including a "continue" command.  Run the program,
    so that the breakpoint is hit, its commands get executed, and the
    program continues and hits the breakpoint again.  You will see
    messages like "warning: Invalid control type in command structure.",
    or maybe GDB will crash.
    When the breakpoint is hit, bpstat_stop_status copies the
    breakpoint's command tree to the bpstat.  bpstat_do_actions then
    calls execute_control_command to run the commands.  The 'continue'
    command invokes the following chain of calls:
      continue_command
        -> clear_proceed_status
          -> bpstat_clear
            -> free_command_lines
               -> frees the commands we are currently running.
    When control does eventually return to execute_control_command, GDB
    continues to walk the tree of freed command nodes, resulting in the
    error messages and / or crashes.
    Since this bug depends on storage being reused between the time that
    we continue and the time that we fall back to bpstat_do_actions, the
    reproduction recipe is more delicate than I would like.  I welcome
    suggestions for improving this.

    This test is to check that a frame's "info frame", especially the
    saved registers list, doesn't change while that frame isn't current.
    It uses the program savedregs.c to construct a somewhat warped
    backtrace (contains both signal and dummy frames) and then, at each
    step checks that non-inner frames have consistent "info frame"
    output.  Note that a frame's "info frame" can only be captured after
    it is non-current (made a call, interrupted, ...), this is because
    instructions executed to perform the call may affect "info frame"
    output.

    Various tests of gdb's ability to follow the parent or child of a
    Unix vfork system call.  A vfork parent is blocked until the child
    either execs or exits --- since those events take somewhat different
    code paths in GDB, both variants are exercised.

    This test checks both $_exitcode and $_exitsignal variables.  The
    purpose of this checking is to ensure that the variables are
    mutually exclusive, i.e., that when $_exitsignal is set, $_exitcode
    is not, and vice-versa.  This mutual exclusion happens because if an
    inferior exited (either successfuly or not), it certainly was not
    killed by a signal.  However, if it was killed by an uncaught
    signal, then there is no way for it to have exited.

    Modified to test gdb's handling of a debug-id retrieval.
    This file has two parts. The first is testing that gdb behaves
    normally after reading in an executable and its corresponding
    separate debug file. The second moves the .debug file to a different
    location and tests the "set debug-file-directory" command.
    The third is for testing build-id retrievel by finding the separate
    ".debug-id/ab/cdef.debug" file.

    Check that GDB can and only executes single instructions when
    stepping through a sequence of breakpoints interleaved by a signal
    handler.
    This test is known to tickle the following problems: kernel letting
    the inferior execute both the system call, and the instruction
    following, when single-stepping a system call; kernel failing to
    propogate the single-step state when single-stepping the sigreturn
    system call, instead resuming the inferior at full speed; GDB
    doesn't know how to software single-step across a sigreturn
    instruction.  Since the kernel problems can be "fixed" using
    software single-step this is KFAILed rather than XFAILed.

    The test program lineinc.c contains a mix of #line directives and
    #include directives that will cause the compiler to attribute more
    than one #inclusion to the same source line.  You can get similar
    effects using things like GCC's '-imacros' flag.
    Compiling lineinc.c with Dwarf 2 macro information will produce
    something like this:

    Note how the inclusions of lineinc1.h and lineinc2.h are both
    attributed to line 10 of lineinc.c, and the #inclusion of lineinc3.h
    is attributed to line 11.  This is all correct, given the #line
    directives in lineinc.c.
    Dwarf 2 macro information doesn't contain enough information to
    allow GDB to figure out what's really going on here --- it makes no
    mention of the #line directives --- so we just try to cope as best
    we can.  If the macro table were to attribute more than one
    #inclusion to the same source line, then GDB wouldn't be able to
    tell which #included file's #definitions and #undefinitions come
    first, so it can't tell which #definitions are in scope following
    all the #inclusions.  To cope with this, GDB puts all the files
    #included by a given source file in a list sorted by the line at
    which they were #included; this gives GDB the chance to detect
    multiple #inclusions at the same line, complain, and assign
    distinct, albiet incorrect, line numbers to each #inclusion.
    However, at one point GDB was sorting the list in reverse order,
    while the code to assign new, distinct line numbers assumed it was
    sorted in ascending order; GDB would get an internal error trying to
    read the above debugging info.

    Make the boards under testsuite/boards automatically available to
    DejaGnu.  This is sourced by the `site.exp' file generated in the
    root of the testsuite's build directory.
    Append GDB's boards dir to DejaGnu's board dir list, making sure
    that that is the last boards dir in the list, so that boards found
    in directories appended to the list by either the global config
    site.exp, or in `$(dirname $DEJAGNU)/boards' override GDB's boards.
    Unfortunately, there's no standard way to get that behavior.  To
    make it happen, we trace all writes to the $boards_dirs global, and
    make sure our dir is always the last in the list.  This relies on
    the fact that DejaGnu always writes to this variable, even if just
    to set it to the empty list, which it does.

    This file is based on config/gdbserver.exp, which was written by
    Michael Snyder (msnyder@redhat.com).
    To be addressed or set in your baseboard config file:
      set_board_info gdb_protocol "remote"
    Unles you have a gdbserver that uses a different protocol...
    After GDB starts you should check global $gdbserver_protocol instead as
    the testfile may force a specific different target protocol itself.
      set_board_info gdb_server_prog
    This will be the path to the gdbserver program you want to test.
    Defaults to "gdbserver".
      set_board_info sockethost
    The name of the host computer whose socket is being used.
    Defaults to "localhost".  Note: old gdbserver requires
    that you define this, but libremote/gdbserver does not.
      set_board_info gdb,socketport
    Port id to use for socket connection.  If not set explicitly,
    it will start at "2345" and increment for each use.
    After GDB starts you should check global $gdbserver_gdbport for the
    real port used.  It is not useful if $gdbserver_reconnect_p was not set.
    gdb_target_cmd
    Send gdb the "target" command

    Generate a test program containing DTrace USDT probes, whose sources
    are ${srcfile} and ${testfile}.d.  The sequence of commands used to
    generate the test program is:
    1. Generate a header file from ${testfile}.d using dtrace -h.
    2. Compile ${srcfile}.c.
    3. Generate an object file containing a DOF program using dtrace -G.
    4. Link everything together to get the test program.
    Note that if DTrace is not found in the host system then this
    function uses the pdtrace implementation, which is located at
    testsuite/lib/pdtrace.
    This function requires 'testfile', 'srcfile' and 'binfile' to be
    properly set.
    This function returns -1 on failure, 0 otherwise

    More tests for different kinds of template parameters,
    templates with partial specializations, nested templates, etc.
    These have been tested only with HP aCC.  They probably won't
    work with other compilers because of differences in mangling
    schemes.

    As of 2000-06-03, C++ support has been improved to the point that g++ can
    pass all of theses, excluding what appears to be one that exposes a stabs bug. - djb
    I don't know how HP could be passing these tests without this. They
    weren't breakpointing past a point where the below expressions were
    initialized in the actual source. - djb

    This test checks the behavior of formatted print when applied to a
    reference value.  The intended behavior is that a formatted print of
    such a value should display the same value as a plain print,
    modulo format, of course.  Older versions of GDB would instead print
    the reference's address value itself when doing a formatted print,
    rather than printing both that and the dereferenced value.  We also
    check that the (non-standard) expression &(&x), where x is of type T&,
    yields an appropriate value.
    This also tests that some other arithmetic operations on references
    work properly: condition expression using a reference object as one of its
    operand.

    In gdb inferior function calls, if a C++ exception is raised in the
    dummy-frame, and the exception handler is (normally, and expected to
    be) out-of-frame, the default C++ handler will (wrongly) be called
    in an inferior function call.
    This is incorrect as an exception can normally and legally be handled
    out-of-frame.  The confines of the dummy frame prevent the unwinder
    from finding the correct handler (or any handler, unless it is
    in-frame).  The default handler calls std::terminate.  This will kill
    the inferior.  Assert that terminate should never be called in an
    inferior function call.  These tests test the functionality around
    unwinding that sequence and also tests the flag behaviour gating this
    functionality.
    PR c++/9600.
    This test is largely based of gdb.base/callfuncs.exp.

    GDB support routines for a board using the MIPS remote debugging
    protocol.  These are actually pretty generic.
    DejaGnu currently assumes that debugging is being done over the main
    console port.  It would probably be more convenient for people using
    IDT boards to permit the debugging port and the connected port to be
    different, since an IDT board has two ports.  This would require
    extending some of the tests in a fashion similar to that done for
    VxWorks, because the test output would appear on the other port,
    rather than being displayed by gdb.

    accepting whatever default dejagnu gives us (apparently 10 seconds).
    When running the tests over NFS, under somewhat heavy load, 10 seconds
    does not seem to be enough.  Try starting with 60.

    This test helps making sure QTro support doesn't regress.  If the
    stub supports the newer qXfer:traceframe-info:read, then the QTro
    paths in the stub are never exercised.  PR remote/15455 is an
    example of a regression that unfortunately went unnoticed for long.

       The opcode library (libopcodes.a) provides instruction decoders for
       a large variety of instruction sets, callable with an identical
       interface, for making instruction-processing programs more independent
       of the instruction set being processed.

       The libiberty library provides a number of functions which are
       missing on some operating systems.  We do not declare those here,
       to avoid conflicts with the system header files on operating
       systems that do support those functions.  In this file we only
       declare those functions which are specific to libiberty.

      As a special exception to the GNU General Public License, if you
      distribute this file as part of a program that contains a
      configuration script generated by Autoconf, you may include it under
      the same distribution terms that you use for the rest of that program.
    The first argument passed to this file is the canonical host specification,
       CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM
    or
       CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-KERNEL-OPERATING_SYSTEM
    The environment variables CC, GCC, LDFLAGS, LD, with_gnu_ld
    should be set by the caller.
    The set of defined variables is at the end of this script.
    Known limitations:
    - On IRIX 6.5 with CC="cc", the run time search patch must not be longer
      than 256 bytes, otherwise the compiler driver will dump core. The only
      known workaround is to choose shorter directory names for the build
      directory and/or the installation directory.
    All known linkers require a `.a' archive for static linking (except M$VC,
    which needs '.lib').

    % To process a Texinfo manual with TeX, it's most reliable to use the
    % texi2dvi shell script that comes with the distribution.  For a simple
    % manual foo.texi, however, you can get away with this:
    %   tex foo.texi
    %   texindex foo.??
    %   tex foo.texi
    %   tex foo.texi
    %   dvips foo.dvi -o  # or whatever; this makes foo.ps.
    % The extra TeX runs get the cross-reference information correct.
    % Sometimes one run after texindex suffices, and sometimes you need more
    % than two; texi2dvi does it as many times as necessary.
    %
    % It is possible to adapt texinfo.tex for other languages, to some
    % extent.  You can get the existing language-specific files from the
    % full Texinfo distribution.
    %
    % The GNU Texinfo home page is http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo.

     * 2005 - Adaptation to Microsoft C Compiler for AMD64 by Gilles Vollant
     *
     * inffas8664.c call function inffas8664fnc in inffasx64.asm
     *  inffasx64.asm is automatically convert from AMD64 portion of inffas86.c
     *
     * Dec-29-2003 -- I added AMD64 inflate asm support.  This version is also
     * slightly quicker on x86 systems because, instead of using rep movsb to copy
     * data, it uses rep movsw, which moves data in 2-byte chunks instead of single
     * bytes.  I've tested the AMD64 code on a Fedora Core 1 + the x86_64 updates
     * from http://fedora.linux.duke.edu/fc1_x86_64
     * which is running on an Athlon 64 3000+ / Gigabyte GA-K8VT800M system with
     * 1GB ram.  The 64-bit version is about 4% faster than the 32-bit version,
     * when decompressing mozilla-source-1.3.tar.gz.
     *
     * Mar-13-2003 -- Most of this is derived from inffast.S which is derived from
     * the gcc -S output of zlib-1.2.0/inffast.c.  Zlib-1.2.0 is in beta release at
     * the moment.  I have successfully compiled and tested this code with gcc2.96,
     * gcc3.2, icc5.0, msvc6.0.  It is very close to the speed of inffast.S
     * compiled with gcc -DNO_MMX, but inffast.S is still faster on the P3 with MMX
     * enabled.  I will attempt to merge the MMX code into this version.  Newer
     * versions of this and inffast.S can be found at
     * http://www.eetbeetee.com/zlib/ and http://www.charm.net/~christop/zlib/

     * This version (Jan-23-2003) of inflate_fast was coded and tested under
     * GNU/Linux on a pentium 3, using the gcc-3.2 compiler distribution.  On that
     * machine, I found that gzip style archives decompressed about 20% faster than
     * the gcc-3.2 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer compiled version.  Your results will
     * depend on how large of a buffer is used for z_stream.next_in & next_out
     * (8K-32K worked best for my 256K cpu cache) and how much overhead there is in
     * stream processing I/O and crc32/addler32.  In my case, this routine used
     * 70% of the cpu time and crc32 used 20%.
     *
     * I am confident that this version will work in the general case, but I have
     * not tested a wide variety of datasets or a wide variety of platforms.
     *
     * Jan-24-2003 -- Added -DUSE_MMX define for slightly faster inflating.
     * It should be a runtime flag instead of compile time flag...
     *
     * Jan-26-2003 -- Added runtime check for MMX support with cpuid instruction.
     * With -DUSE_MMX, only MMX code is compiled.  With -DNO_MMX, only non-MMX code
     * is compiled.  Without either option, runtime detection is enabled.  Runtime
     * detection should work on all modern cpus and the recomended algorithm (flip
     * ID bit on eflags and then use the cpuid instruction) is used in many
     * multimedia applications.  Tested under win2k with gcc-2.95 and gas-2.12
     * distributed with cygwin3.  Compiling with gcc-2.95 -c inffast.S -o
     * inffast.obj generates a COFF object which can then be linked with MSVC++
     * compiled code.  Tested under FreeBSD 4.7 with gcc-2.95.
     *
     * Jan-28-2003 -- Tested Athlon XP... MMX mode is slower than no MMX (and
     * slower than compiler generated code).  Adjusted cpuid check to use the MMX
     * code only for Pentiums < P4 until I have more data on the P4.  Speed
     * improvment is only about 15% on the Athlon when compared with code generated
     * with MSVC++.  Not sure yet, but I think the P4 will also be slower using the
     * MMX mode because many of it's x86 ALU instructions execute in .5 cycles and
     * have less latency than MMX ops.  Added code to buffer the last 11 bytes of
     * the input stream since the MMX code grabs bits in chunks of 32, which
     * differs from the inffast.c algorithm.  I don't think there would have been
     * read overruns where a page boundary was crossed (a segfault), but there
     * could have been overruns when next_in ends on unaligned memory (unintialized
     * memory read).
     *
     * Mar-13-2003 -- P4 MMX is slightly slower than P4 NO_MMX.  I created a C
     * version of the non-MMX code so that it doesn't depend on zstrm and zstate
     * structure offsets which are hard coded in this file.  This was last tested
     * with zlib-1.2.0 which is currently in beta testing, newer versions of this
     * and inffas86.c can be found at http://www.eetbeetee.com/zlib/ and
     * http://www.charm.net/~christop/zlib/

     *
     * Dec-29-2003 -- I added AMD64 inflate asm support.  This version is also
     * slightly quicker on x86 systems because, instead of using rep movsb to copy
     * data, it uses rep movsw, which moves data in 2-byte chunks instead of single
     * bytes.  I've tested the AMD64 code on a Fedora Core 1 + the x86_64 updates
     * from http://fedora.linux.duke.edu/fc1_x86_64
     * which is running on an Athlon 64 3000+ / Gigabyte GA-K8VT800M system with
     * 1GB ram.  The 64-bit version is about 4% faster than the 32-bit version,
     * when decompressing mozilla-source-1.3.tar.gz.
     *
     * Mar-13-2003 -- Most of this is derived from inffast.S which is derived from
     * the gcc -S output of zlib-1.2.0/inffast.c.  Zlib-1.2.0 is in beta release at
     * the moment.  I have successfully compiled and tested this code with gcc2.96,
     * gcc3.2, icc5.0, msvc6.0.  It is very close to the speed of inffast.S
     * compiled with gcc -DNO_MMX, but inffast.S is still faster on the P3 with MMX
     * enabled.  I will attempt to merge the MMX code into this version.  Newer
     * versions of this and inffast.S can be found at
     * http://www.eetbeetee.com/zlib/ and http://www.charm.net/~christop/zlib/

      Decryption code comes from crypt.c by Info-ZIP but has been greatly reduced in terms of
      compatibility with older software. The following is from the original crypt.c.
      Code woven in by Terry Thorsen 1/2003.

      The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
      non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
      whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
      (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)
            This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
      Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
      file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
      version without encryption capabilities).

            Copyright (C) 2007-2008 Even Rouault
            Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Removed cpl_* from symbol names (Even Rouault added them but since this is now moved to a new project (minizip64) I renamed them again).
      Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Fixed problem if uncompressed size was > 4G and compressed size was <4G
                                    should only read the compressed/uncompressed size from the Zip64 format if
                                    the size from normal header was 0xFFFFFFFF
      Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Applied some bug fixes from paches recived from Gilles Vollant
            Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Applied support to unzip files with compression mathod BZIP2 (bzip2 lib is required)
                                    Patch created by Daniel Borca
      Jan-2010 - back to unzip and minizip 1.0 name scheme, with compatibility layer

       This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution
       The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
       non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
       whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
       (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)
       This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
       Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
       file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
       version without encryption capabilities).
       If you don't need crypting in your application, just define symbols
       NOCRYPT and NOUNCRYPT.
       This code support the "Traditional PKWARE Encryption".
       The new AES encryption added on Zip format by Winzip (see the page
       http://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm ) and PKWare PKZip 5.x Strong
       Encryption is not supported.

    /*
       gzappend takes a gzip file and appends to it, compressing files from the
       command line or data from stdin.  The gzip file is written to directly, to
       avoid copying that file, in case it's large.  Note that this results in the
       unfriendly behavior that if gzappend fails, the gzip file is corrupted.
       This program was written to illustrate the use of the new Z_BLOCK option of
       zlib 1.2.x's inflate() function.  This option returns from inflate() at each
       block boundary to facilitate locating and modifying the last block bit at
       the start of the final deflate block.  Also whether using Z_BLOCK or not,
       another required feature of zlib 1.2.x is that inflate() now provides the
       number of unusued bits in the last input byte used.  gzappend will not work
       with versions of zlib earlier than 1.2.1.
       gzappend first decompresses the gzip file internally, discarding all but
       the last 32K of uncompressed data, and noting the location of the last block
       bit and the number of unused bits in the last byte of the compressed data.
       The gzip trailer containing the CRC-32 and length of the uncompressed data
       is verified.  This trailer will be later overwritten.
       Then the last block bit is cleared by seeking back in the file and rewriting
       the byte that contains it.  Seeking forward, the last byte of the compressed
       data is saved along with the number of unused bits to initialize deflate.
       A deflate process is initialized, using the last 32K of the uncompressed
       data from the gzip file to initialize the dictionary.  If the total
       uncompressed data was less than 32K, then all of it is used to initialize
       the dictionary.  The deflate output bit buffer is also initialized with the
       last bits from the original deflate stream.  From here on, the data to
       append is simply compressed using deflate, and written to the gzip file.
       When that is complete, the new CRC-32 and uncompressed length are written
       as the trailer of the gzip file.
