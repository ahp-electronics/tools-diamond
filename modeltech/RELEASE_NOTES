   Key Information
     * QSIM-555 - Systemc/GCC Changes starting 2020.1:
       o SystemC/DPI/PLI/VPI/FLI default compiler (GCC) for linux and
       linux_x86_64 platforms is upgraded to 7.4.0
       o GCC 4.5.0 is no longer supported and it will no longer be
       distributed with the release. This affects linux and linux_x86_64
       platforms only.
       o Supported compilers on linux and linux_x86_64 platforms:
       gcc-7.4.0, gcc-5.3.0 and gcc-4.7.4
       o Support for the IEEE 1666-2005 SystemC-2.2 standard has been
       deprecated and it is no longer supported.
     * Starting 2021.1 release, Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 platform
       will not be supported.

   Release Announcements in 2020.3
     * Due to enhanced security restrictions with web browser PDF
       plug-ins, some links do not function. Links in HTML documentation
       are fully functional.
       Clicking a link within a PDF viewed in a web browser may result in
       no action, or it may load the title page of the current PDF manual
       (instead of the intended target in the PDF manual). The unresolved
       link behavior occurs in all web browsers on Windows and Linux
       platforms. Because of this behavior, the navigational experience of
       PDF manuals is compromised. PDF is ideal for printing because of
       its page-oriented layout.
       Use the HTML manuals to search for topics, navigate between topics,
       and click links to examples, videos, reference material, and other
       related technical content.
       For information about Adobe's discontinued support of Adobe Reader
       on Linux platforms and your available options, refer to Knowledge
       Article MG596568 on SupportNet.
       Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the U.S. and
       other countries.
     * Since 2019.1 release, support for Windows 7 and 8.1 have
       discontinued. Only Windows 10 is supported. However, we continue to
       support Windows 7 & 8.1 with our 10.7 release series until their
       planned End Of Life (10.7 EOL - mid 2020)
     * Starting 2020.2 release, support for Universal VHDL Verification
       Methodology has been added to Questa Simulation.
       The UVVM library is included in this download

   Compatibility Issues with Release 2020.3

   SystemVerilog Compatibility
     * QSIM-62783 - (source) Vlog and vopt handled cases where a class had
       the same name as a package incorrectly in some cases. Given this
       example:<code>
       package P ;
       typedef logic type1_t;
       class P;
       typedef logic type2_t;
       endclass
       endpackage
       import P::*; // Import in $unit scope makes class named "P"
       potentially visible
       module top;
       P::type1_t i; // This should be an error because "P" should
       reference the class
       P::type2_t j; // This should resolve to the type in class "P"
       endmodule
       </code>
       The correct behavior is to report an error for P::type1_t and
       accept P::type2_t, but previous releases reversed that behavior.
     * QSIM-62590 - (source) In some cases, a randomize() call with
       in-line constraints, if the constraint symbol is not declared, it
       would insert dummy symbol instead, this now flags an error.

   SystemVerilog Defects Repaired in 2020.3
     * QSIM-62783 - (source) Vlog and vopt handled cases where a class had
       the same name as a package incorrectly in some cases. Given this

       typedef logic type1_t;
       class P;
       typedef logic type2_t;
       endclass
       endpackage
       import P::*; // Import in $unit scope makes class named "P"
       potentially visible
       module top;
       P::type1_t i; // This should be an error because "P" should
       reference the class
       P::type2_t j; // This should resolve to the type in class "P"
       endmodule

   Mixed Language Defects Repaired in 2020.3
     * QSIM-64244 - When Verilog instantiates a VHDL design unit,
       processing for connectivity analysis under the -rnm vopt switch did
       not correctly handle ports associated by-name.
