<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B>scintilla</B> command creates a new window (given by the <I>pathName</I>  arg)
       and  makes  it  into  a  Scintilla  text  widget.  Additional  options,
              <B>clearall</B>
                     removes annotation strings for all lines

              <B>get</B> <I>line</I>
                     Returns the annotation text for the specified line.

              <B>set</B> <I>line</I> <I>text</I> <I>?tagName</I> <I>text</I> <I>tagName</I> <I>...?</I>
                     Assigns  the specified text string to the specified line.
                     If no tagName option is specified,  the  annotation  text
                     will  use  the  default text styling. If a single tagName
                     option is used it will control the appearance for all  of
                     the  annotation  text. By using multiple text and tagName
                     options it's possible to have different  appearances  for
                     different subranges of the text.

              <B>show</B> <I>0|1|2</I>
                     Used to control the display of annotations where 0 - hid-
                     ing, 1 - showing or 2 -  showing  with  a  bounding  box.
                     Note, this affects all lines with annotations.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>bbox</B> <I>index</I>
              Returns  a  list  of four elements describing the screen area of
              the character given by index. The first two elements of the list
              give  the  x  and  y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the
              area occupied by the character, and the last two  elements  give
              the  width and height of the area. If the character is not visi-
              ble on the screen then the return value is an empty list.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>cget</B> <I>option</I>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option  given  by
              option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the scin-
              tilla command.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>compare</B> <I>index1</I> <I>op</I> <I>index2</I>
              Compares the indices given by index1 and index2 according to the
              relational  operator given by op, and returns 1 if the relation-
              ship is satisfied and 0 if it is not. Op  must  be  one  of  the
              operators  &lt;,  &lt;=, =, &gt;, &gt;, or !. If op is == then 1 is returned
              if the two indices refer to the same character, if op is &lt;  then
              1  is  returned  if index1 refers to an earlier character in the
              text than index2, and so on.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>configure</B> <I>?option?</I> <I>?value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> <I>...?</I>
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If  no
              option is specified, returns a list describing all of the avail-
              able options for pathName. If option is specified with no value,
              then  the command returns a list describing the one named option
              (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
              value  returned  if  no  option  is  specified).  If one or more
              option-value pairs are specified, then the command modifies  the
              given  widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case
              the command returns an empty string. Option may have any of  the

              <B>-displaylines</B>
                     count  all  display  lines  (i.e.  ignore lines which are
                     folded) from the line of the first index up to,  but  not
                     including the display line of the second index. Therefore
                     if they are both on the same display line, zero  will  be
                     returned.  By  definition  displaylines  are  visible and
                     therefore this only counts  portions  of  actual  visible
                     lines.

              <B>-lines</B> count  all  lines (irrespective of folding) from the line
                     of the first index up to, but not including the  line  of
                     the  second index. Therefore if they are both on the same
                     line, zero will be returned. Lines  are  counted  whether
                     they are currently visible (non-folded) or not.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <I>index1</I> <I>?index2?</I>
              Delete  a  range of characters from the text. If both index1 and
              index2 are specified, then delete all  the  characters  starting
              with  the  one  given  by index1 and stopping just before index2
              (i.e. the character at index2 is not deleted). If index2 doesn't
              specify a position later in the text than index1 then no charac-
              ters are deleted. If index2  isn't  specified  then  the  single
              character  at  index1  is deleted. It is not allowable to delete
              characters in a way that would leave the text without a  newline
              as the last character. The command returns an empty string.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>dump</B> <I>?switches?</I> <I>index1</I> <I>?index2?</I><B>_</B>
              Return  the  contents  of the text widget from index1 up to, but
              not including index2, including the text and  information  about
              marks,  tags,  and embedded windows. If index2 is not specified,
              then it defaults to one character past index1.  The  information
              is  returned  in  the following format:: key1 value1 index1 key2
              value2 index2 ...  The  possible  key  values  are  indicatoron,
              indicatoroff,  text,  mark,  styleon,  styleoff,  tagon, tagoff,
              image, and window. The  corresponding  value  is  the  indicator
              type,  text,  mark  name, style number, tag name, image name, or
              window name. The index information is the index of the start  of
              the  indicator  transition,  style  transition,  text, mark, tag
              transition, image or window. The image and  window  options  are
              not  supported  and will return nothing. One or more of the fol-
              lowing switches (or abbreviations thereof) may be  specified  to
              control the dump:

              <B>-all</B>   Return  information about all elements: indicator, style,
                     text, marks,  tags,  images  and  windows.  This  is  the
                     default.

              <B>-command</B> <I>command</I>
                     Instead of returning the information as the result of the
                     dump operation, invoke the command on each element of the
                     text widget within the range. The command has three argu-

              <B>-style</B> Include  information  about style transitions in the dump
                     results. Style information is  returned  as  styleon  and
                     styleoff elements that indicate the begin and end of each
                     range of each style, respectively.

              <B>-tag</B>   Include information about tag  transitions  in  the  dump
                     results.  Tag information is returned as tagon and tagoff
                     elements that indicate the begin and end of each range of
                     each tag, respectively.

              <B>-text</B>  Include  information  about text in the dump results. The
                     value is the text up to the next element or  the  end  of
                     range  indicated  by index2. A text element does not span
                     newlines. A multi-line block of  text  that  contains  no
                     marks or tag transitions will still be dumped as a set of
                     text segments that each end with a newline.  The  newline
                     is part of the value.

              <B>-window</B>
                     Include  information  about  embedded windows in the dump
                     results. This option is unsupported in Scintilla.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>edit</B> <I>option</I> <I>?arg</I> <I>arg</I> <I>...?</I>
              This command controls the undo mechanism and the modified  flag.
              The exact behavior of the command depends on the option argument
              that follows the edit argument. The following forms of the  com-
              mand are currently supported:

              <I>pathName</I> <B>edit</B> <B>canredo</B>
                     Returns true if the redo stack is not empty.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>edit</B> <B>canundo</B>
                     Returns true if the undo stack is not empty.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>edit</B> <B>Imodified</B> <I>?boolean?</I>
                     If boolean is not specified, returns the modified flag of
                     the widget. The insert, delete, edit undo and  edit  redo
                     commands  or the user can set or clear the modified flag.
                     If boolean is specified, sets the modified  flag  of  the
                     widget to boolean.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>edit</B> <B>redo</B>
                     When  the -undo option is true, reapplies the last undone
                     edits provided no other edits were done since then.  Gen-
                     erates  an error when the redo stack is empty. Does noth-
                     ing when the -undo option is false.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>edit</B> <B>reset</B>
                     Clears the undo and redo stacks.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>edit</B> <B>separator</B>
                     Inserts a separator (boundary) on the  undo  stack.  Does

              document. The following commands are supported:

              <B>foldall</B>
                     folds all lines within the document

              <B>foldbelow</B> <I>line</I>
                     folds all lines which are after(below) line number line

              <B>foldparent</B> <I>line</I>
                     returns  the line containing the immediate fold parent of
                     line

              <B>foldroot</B> <I>line</I>
                     returns the line containing topmost fold  parent  of  the
                     specified line . This is at the top of the fold hierarchy
                     containing line .

              <B>isfolded</B> <I>line</I>
                     return 1 if line contained in a folded parent, and  0  if
                     it isn't

              <B>show</B> <I>line</I>
                     fully expand the containing fold hierarchy such that line
                     is visible

              <B>toggle</B> <I>line</I>
                     toggle the fold state of line (ie  if  collapsed,  expand
                     it; if expanded, collapse it)

              <B>topunfolded</B> <I>line</I>
                     return the line of the highest fold parent for line which
                     is currently expanded

              <B>unfoldall</B>
                     unfold all lines

              <B>unfoldbelow</B> <I>line</I>
                     unfold all lines which are after(below) line number line

       <I>pathName</I> <B>index</B> <I>index</I> <I>?-textonly?</I>
              Returns  the  position  corresponding  to  index  in  the   form
              line.char  where line is the line number and char is the charac-
              ter number. See the documentation for the Tk Text widget  for  a
              description of the formats used to specify indices. NOTE: Speci-
              fying an X/Y location that corresponds to a line  of  annotation
              text  will  return  the index for the end of the line associated
              with the annotation. If the -textonly option is  used,  then  an
              empty  string is returned if the X/Y location is over an annota-
              tion.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>insert</B> <I>index</I> <I>chars</I>
              Inserts all of the chars argument just before the  character  at
              alias name defined for the margin. The following  forms  of  the
              command are currently supported:

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>bbox</B> <I>marginID</I> <I>line</I>
                     Returns  a  list  of  four elements describing the screen
                     area of the margin identified by marginID,  at  the  line
                     specified  by  line.  The  first two elements of the list
                     give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner  of
                     the area occupied by the character, and the last two ele-
                     ments give the width and height of the area. If the char-
                     acter  is not visible on the screen then the return value
                     is an empty list.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>cget</B> <I>marginID</I> <I>option</I>
                     This command returns the  current  value  of  the  option
                     named   option   associated  with  the  margin  given  by
                     marginID. Option may have any of the values  accepted  by
                     the pathName margin configure widget command.

              <I>pathName</I>  <B>margin</B>  <B>configure</B>  <I>marginID</I>  <I>?option?</I>  <I>?value?</I> <I>?option</I>
              <I>value</I> <I>...?</I>
                     This  command is similar to the pathName configure widget
                     command except that it modifies options  associated  with
                     the margin given by marginID instead of modifying options
                     for the overall text widget. If no option  is  specified,
                     the  command  returns a list describing all of the avail-
                     able options for marginID. If option is specified with no
                     value, then the command returns a list describing the one
                     named option (this list will be identical to  the  corre-
                     sponding  sublist  of  the value returned if no option is
                     specified). If one or more option-value pairs are  speci-
                     fied,  then  the  command modifies the given option(s) to
                     have the given value(s) in marginID;  in  this  case  the
                     command returns an empty string.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>count</B>
                     Returns the number of margins

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>dump</B> <I>marginID</I> <I>?option?</I> <I>Index1</I> <I>?Index2?</I>
                     Return the contents of the text widget from index1 up to,
                     but not including index2, including the text and informa-
                     tion  about  marks, tags, and embedded windows. If index2
                     is not specified, then it defaults to one character  past
                     index1. The information is returned in the following for-
                     mat:: key1 value1 index1 key2 value2 index2 ...  The pos-
                     sible  key  values  are  indicatoron, indicatoroff, text,
                     mark, styleon, styleoff, tagon, and  tagoff.  The  corre-
                     sponding  value  is  the indicator type, text, mark name,
                     style number, or tag name. The index information  is  the
                     index  within  the  margin  of the start of the indicator
                     transition, style transition, text, mark, tag transition,
                     image  or  window.  One or more of the following switches
                     Include information about indicator  transitions  in  the
                     dump  results. Indicator information is returned as indi-
                     catoron and indicatoroff elements that indicate the begin
                     and end of each range of each indicator, respectively.

              <B>-mark</B>  Include information about marks in the dump results.

              <B>-style</B> Include  information  about style transitions in the dump
                     results. Style information is  returned  as  styleon  and
                     styleoff elements that indicate the begin and end of each
                     range of each style, respectively.

              <B>-tag</B>   Include information about tag  transitions  in  the  dump
                     results.  Tag information is returned as tagon and tagoff
                     elements that indicate the begin and end of each range of
                     each tag, respectively.

              <B>-text</B>  Include  information  about text in the dump results. The
                     value is the text up to the next element or  the  end  of
                     range  indicated  by index2. A text element does not span
                     newlines. A multi-line block of  text  that  contains  no
                     marks or tag transitions will still be dumped as a set of
                     text segments that each end with a newline.  The  newline
                     is part of the value.

              <I>...}?</I>
                     This  would be used to manually managing filling a margin
                     with line numbers. This is really  only  used  for  cases
                     when  control  over the appearance of the line numbers is
                     needed. The fillnumbers command would  be  called  within
                     the  -linesaddedcommand  callback  function  in  a margin
                     whose type was set to  "lnums_alt".  Setting  the  margin
                     type  to  "lnums" would result in the Scintilla core code
                     handling filling of the line numbers.  The  start  option
                     identifies  where  the  line  numbering should begin. The
                     count option controls how many lines will be  numbers.  A
                     value  of &lt;= 0 will number all lines from start until the
                     end of the document. To apply custom styling  to  one  or
                     more  line  numbers,  first configure a tag named tagName
                     and then identify the list of line numbers as  the  argu-
                     ment  following  tagName.  For  example, to fill the line
                     numbers from 1 to 10  where  only  the  odd  numbers  are
                     styled  in  red,  first create a tag (ex: $sci tag config
                     red -margin -fg red) and then execute $sci  margin  fill-
                     numbers 1 10 red {1 3 5 7 9}.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>hide</B> <I>marginID</I>
                     Hides the margin specified by marginID. The margin's con-
                     figuration information is maintained while hidden.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>index</B> <I>@X,Y</I>
                     identifies  which  lines to add or remove the marker for.
                     When removing, if the lines list is empty, then the spec-
                     ified  marker would be removed from all lines. Also, when
                     removing, if the markerName is set to "*", then all mark-
                     ers present for the specified lines would be removed.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>marker</B> <I>marginID</I> <I>list</I> <I>markerName</I> <I>?line?</I>
                     This  command  returns a list of the lines containing the
                     specified marker. If markerName is specified as  "*"  the
                     line  argument is required. When this done, the all mark-
                     ers present on the specified line will be returned.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>names</B>
                     Returns information about each of the margins. Each  mar-
                     gin  is identified by a three element list containing the
                     following: 1) the ID value of the margin  (where  "0"  is
                     the  leftmost  margin), 2) the type of the margin, and 3)
                     the alias name, or an empty string  if  one  hasn't  been
                     defined.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>show</B> <I>marginID</I>
                     Shows  the margin specified by marginID. For margins that
                     have not yet had a width set (ie their  width  is  zero),
                     the  show  operation will report an error unless the mar-
                     gin's type is set for linenumbers  or  the  special  fold
                     margin.  For those margins, the widget will automatically
                     determine the appropriate width to use in order to  allow
                     the margin to be made visible.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>tag</B> <I>{line</I> <I>...}</I> <I>?tagName</I> <I>-clear?</I>
                     This  command  will  either  add or remove a tag that was
                     previously configured for use in  the  margin  area  (see
                     here  for  more details). The margin tag will affect only
                     text-based margins (ie not those  holding  symbols).  The
                     tag  named  tagName  will  be  added to the list of lines
                     unless the -clear option is specified, in which case  the
                     tag  will  be  removed.  When  removing  a tag, it can be
                     removed from all lines by specifying an  empty  list  for
                     the  lines. To remove all margin tags from all lines, the
                     tagName option should not be specified  (ie  $sci  margin
                     tag {} -clear).

              <I>pathName</I> <B>margin</B> <B>text</B> <I>marginID</I> <I>command</I> <I>arglist</I>
                     This command is used to manipulate the margin text within
                     the margin specified by marginID. The margin specified by
                     marginID  must  be  of  type text or rtext. The operation
                     performed is controlled by the  command  argument,  which
                     would  either be one of "clear", "get", or "set". If com-
                     mand is "clear", and there is no arglist, then the margin
                     text for all lines in the document is removed. If arglist
                     is provided, it is a list of one or more lines to  clear.
                     If  the command argument is "get", the arglist must spec-

       <I>pathName</I> <B>mark</B> <I>option</I> <I>?arg</I> <I>arg</I> <I>...?</I>
              This  command is used to manipulate marks. The exact behavior of
              the command depends on the option argument that follows the mark
              argument.  The following forms of the command are currently sup-
              ported:

              <I>pathName</I> <B>mark</B> <B>exists</B> <I>markName</I>
                     If markName exists, the command will return 1;  otherwise
                     0 is returned.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>mark</B> <B>gravity</B> <I>markName</I> <I>?direction?</I>
                     If  direction  is not specified, returns left or right to
                     indicate which of its  adjacent  characters  markName  is
                     attached  to.  If direction is specified, it must be left
                     or right; the gravity of markName is  set  to  the  given
                     value.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>mark</B> <B>names</B>
                     Returns  a  list  whose elements are the names of all the
                     marks that are currently set.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>mark</B> <B>next</B> <I>index</I>
                     Returns the name of the next mark at or after  index.  If
                     index is specified in numerical form, then the search for
                     the next mark begins at that index. If index is the  name
                     of a mark, then the search for the next mark begins imme-
                     diately after that mark. This can still return a mark  at
                     the same position if there are multiple marks at the same
                     index. These semantics mean that the mark next  operation
                     can  be used to step through all the marks in a text wid-
                     get. An empty string is returned if there  are  no  marks
                     after index.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>mark</B> <B>previous</B> <I>index</I>
                     Returns the name of the mark at or before index. If index
                     is specified in numerical form, then the search  for  the
                     previous  mark begins with the character just before that
                     index. If index is the name of a mark,  then  the  search
                     for  the  next  mark begins immediately before that mark.
                     This can still return a mark  at  the  same  position  if
                     there  are multiple marks at the same index. These seman-
                     tics mean that the mark previous operation can be used to
                     step  through  all  the  marks in a text widget. An empty
                     string is returned if there are no marks before index.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>mark</B> <B>set</B> <I>markName</I> <I>index</I>
                     Sets the mark named markName to a  position  just  before
                     the character at index. If markName already exists, it is
                     moved from its old position; if it does not exist, a  new
                     mark is created. This command returns an empty string.

              <I>pathName</I>  <B>marker</B>  <B>configure</B>  <I>markerName</I>  <I>?option?</I>  <I>?value</I> <I>option</I>
              <I>value</I> <I>...?</I>
                     This  command is similar to the pathName configure widget
                     command except that it modifies options  associated  with
                     the marker given by markName instead of modifying options
                     for the overall widget. If no option  is  specified,  the
                     command  returns  a  list describing all of the available
                     options for markerName. If option is  specified  with  no
                     value, then the command returns a list describing the one
                     named option (this list will be identical to  the  corre-
                     sponding  sublist  of  the value returned if no option is
                     specified). If one or more option-value pairs are  speci-
                     fied,  then  the  command modifies the given option(s) to
                     have the given value(s) in markerName; in this  case  the
                     command returns an empty string.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>marker</B> <B>delete</B> <I>markerName</I> <I>?markerName</I> <I>...?</I>
                     Deletes the named markers

              <I>pathName</I> <B>marker</B> <B>exists</B> <I>markerName</I> <I>line</I>
                     Checks  if  the marker specified by markerName exists for
                     line. Returns 1 if it does, 0 otherwise.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>marker</B> <B>names</B>
                     Returns a sorted list of all  currently  defined  markers
                     (created by using the marker configure command).

              <I>pathName</I> <B>marker</B> <B>types</B>
                     Returns the list of type names which can be used with the
                     -type option to the configure command.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>search</B> <I>?switches?</I> <I>pattern</I> <I>index</I> <I>?stopIndex?</I>
              Searches the text in pathName starting at index for a  range  of
              characters  that matches pattern. If a match is found, the index
              of the first character in the match is returned as result;  oth-
              erwise an empty string is returned. One or more of the following
              switches (or abbreviations thereof) may be specified to  control
              the search:

              <B>-forwards</B>
                     The search will proceed forward through the text, finding
                     the first matching range starting at or after  the  posi-
                     tion given by index. This is the default.

              <B>-backwards</B>
                     The  search will proceed backward through the text, find-
                     ing the matching range closest to index whose first char-
                     acter is before index (it is not allowed to be at index).
                     Note that, for a variety of reasons,  backwards  searches
                     can  be substantially slower than forwards searches (par-
                     ticularly when using -regexp), so it is recommended  that
                     performance-critical code use forward searches.

              <B>-nolinestop</B>
                     This allows . and [^ sequences to match the newline char-
                     acter  0 which they will otherwise not do (see the regexp
                     command for details). This option is only  meaningful  if
                     -regexp is also given, and an error will be thrown other-
                     wise. For example, to match the entire text, use pathName
                     search -nolinestop -regexp ".*" 1.0.

              <B>-nocase</B>
                     Ignore case differences between the pattern and the text.

              <B>-count</B> <I>varName</I>
                     The argument following -count gives the name of  a  vari-
                     able;  if a match is found, the number of index positions
                     between beginning and end of the matching range  will  be
                     stored  in  the variable. If there are no embedded images
                     or windows in the matching range (and there are no elided
                     characters if -elide is not given), this is equivalent to
                     the number of characters matched.  In  either  case,  the
                     range matchIdx to matchIdx + $count chars will return the
                     entire matched text.

              <B>-all</B>   Find all matches in the given range and return a list  of
                     the  indices  of  the first character of each match. If a
                     -count varName switch is given, then varName is also  set
                     to  a  list  containing  one  element for each successful
                     match. Note that, even for exact searches,  the  elements
                     of  this  list  may  be  different, if there are embedded
                     images, windows or hidden text. Searches with -all behave
                     very  similarly  to  the Tcl command regexp -all, in that
                     overlapping matches are not normally returned. For  exam-
                     ple, applying an -all search of the pattern 1992Z against
                     ZooZooZoo will just match once.

              <B>-overlap</B>
                     When performing -all searches, the  normal  behaviour  is
                     that  matches  which  overlap an already-found match will
                     not be returned. This switch changes  that  behaviour  so
                     that  all  matches  which are not totally enclosed within
                     another match are  returned.  For  example,  applying  an
                     -overlap  search  of  the pattern 2304Z against ZooZooZoo
                     will now match twice. An error will  be  thrown  if  this
                     switch is used without -all.

              <B>-strictlimits</B>
                     When  performing any search, the normal behaviour is that
                     the start and stop limits are checked with respect to the
                     start  of the matching text. With the -strictlimits flag,
                     the entire matching range must lie inside the  start  and
                     stop limits specified for the match to be valid.

       searches, no match at or after stopIndex will be considered; for  back-
       ward searches, no match earlier in the text than stopIndex will be con-
       sidered. If stopIndex is omitted, the entire  text  will  be  searched:
       when  the beginning or end of the text is reached, the search continues
       at the other end until the  starting  location  is  reached  again;  if
       stopIndex is specified, no wrap-around will occur. This means that, for
       example, if the search is -forwards but stopIndex  is  earlier  in  the
       text  than startIndex, nothing will ever be found. See the Tk Text wid-
       get man page for more information.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>scisearch</B> <I>?switches?</I> <I>pattern</I> <I>index</I> <I>?stopIndex?</I>
              Scintilla Search searches the text in pathName starting at index
              for  a  range  of characters that matches pattern. If a match is
              found, the index of the first character in the match is returned
              as result; otherwise an empty string is returned. One or more of
              the following switches (or abbreviations thereof) may be  speci-
              fied to control the search:

              <B>-forwards</B>
                     The search will proceed forward through the text, finding
                     the first matching range starting at or after  the  posi-
                     tion given by index. This is the default.

              <B>-backwards</B>
                     The  search will proceed backward through the text, find-
                     ing the matching range closest to index whose first char-
                     acter is before index (it is not allowed to be at index).

              <B>-count</B> <I>varName</I>
                     The argument following -count gives the name of  a  vari-
                     able;  if a match is found, the number of index positions
                     between beginning and end of the matching range  will  be
                     stored in the variable.

              <B>-exact</B> Use  exact matching: the characters in the matching range
                     must be identical  to  those  in  pattern.  This  is  the
                     default.

              <B>-nocase</B>
                     Ignore case differences between the pattern and the text.

              <B>-regexp</B>
                     Treat pattern as  a  regular  expression.  In  a  regular
                     expression, special characters interpreted are:

                     Matches any character.

                      <B>\(</B>     This  marks  the  start of a region for tagging a
                             match.

                      <B>\)</B>     This marks the end of a tagged region.

                      <B>\x</B>     This allows you to use a character x  that  would
                             otherwise have a special meaning. For example, \[
                             would be interpreted as [ and not as the start of
                             a character set.

                      <B>[...]</B>  This  indicates a set of characters, for example,
                             [abc] means any of the characters a, b or c.  You
                             can  also  use  ranges, for example [a-z] for any
                             lower case character.

                      <B>[^...]</B> The complement of the characters in the set.  For
                             example,  [^A-Za-z] means any character except an
                             alphabetic character.

                      <B>^</B>      This matches the start of  a  line  (unless  used
                             inside a set, see above).

                      <B>$</B>      This matches the end of a line.

                      <B>*</B>      This  matches  0 or more times. For example, Sa*m
                             matches Sm, Sam, Saam, Saaam and so on.

                      <B>+</B>      This matches 1 or more times. For  example,  Sa+m
                             matches Sam, Saam, Saaam and so on.
              Regular expressions will only match ranges within a single line,
              never matching over multiple lines.

              <B>-word</B>  A match only occurs if the characters  before  and  after
                     are not word characters.

              <B>--</B>     This switch has no effect except to terminate the list of
                     switches: the next argument will be  treated  as  pattern
                     even if it starts with -.
       The  matching  range  must be within a single line of text. For regular
       expression matching one can use the various  newline-matching  features
       such  as  $  to  match the end of a line, ^ to match the beginning of a
       line. If stopIndex is specified, the search stops at  that  index:  for
       forward  searches,  no  match at or after stopIndex will be considered;
       for backward searches, no match earlier in the text than stopIndex will
       be  considered.  If  stopIndex  is  omitted,  the  entire  text will be
       searched.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>see</B> <I>index</I> <I>?-center?</I>
              Adjusts the view in the window so that the  character  given  by
              index  is  completely  visible. If index is already visible then
              the command does nothing. If index is a short  distance  out  of
              view,  the  command  adjusts  the view just enough to make index
              visible at the edge of the window. If index is far out of  view,
              then the command centers index in the window. The -center option
              can be used to force index to be centered in the window.

       <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <I>?option?</I> <I>?arg</I> <I>arg</I> <I>...?</I>

              <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>add</B> <I>tagName</I> <I>index1</I> <I>?index2?</I>
                     Associate  the  tag  tagName  (one  will be created if it
                     doesn't already exist) with all of the characters  start-
                     ing  with index1 and ending just before index2 (the char-
                     acter at index2 is not tagged). If index2 is omitted then
                     the single character at index1 is tagged. If there are no
                     characters in the specified range (e.g.  index1  is  past
                     the  end  of  the file or index2 is less than or equal to
                     index1) then the command has  no  effect.  EXCEPTION:  If
                     tagName  is  the  predefined  selection tag (i.e. "sel"),
                     then specifying index2 to be less than index1  will  have
                     the  effect  of  positioning  the  insertion point at the
                     start of the selection.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>bind</B> <I>tagName</I> <I>?sequence?</I> <I>?script?</I>
                     This command associates script with the tag given by tag-
                     Name.  Whenever  the  event  sequence  given  by sequence
                     occurs for a character that has been tagged with tagName,
                     the  script will be invoked. This widget command is simi-
                     lar to the bind command except that it operates on  char-
                     acters in a text rather than entire widgets. See the bind
                     manual entry  for  complete  details  on  the  syntax  of
                     sequence and the substitutions performed on script before
                     invoking it. If all arguments are specified  then  a  new
                     binding  is  created,  replacing any existing binding for
                     the same sequence and tagName (if the first character  of
                     script  is  +  then  script  augments an existing binding
                     rather than replacing it). In this case the return  value
                     is an empty string. If script is omitted then the command
                     returns the script associated with tagName  and  sequence
                     (an  error  occurs  if there is no such binding). If both
                     script and sequence are omitted then the command  returns
                     a  list of all the sequences for which bindings have been
                     defined for tagName. The only events for  which  bindings
                     may  be specified are those related to the mouse and key-
                     board (such as Enter,  Leave,  ButtonPress,  Motion,  and
                     KeyPress)  or  virtual  events. Event bindings for a text
                     widget use the current mark. An Enter event triggers  for
                     a  tag  when the tag first becomes present on the current
                     character, and a Leave event triggers for a tag  when  it
                     ceases  to be present on the current character. Enter and
                     Leave events can happen either because the  current  mark
                     moved  or because the character at that position changed.
                     Note that these events are different than Enter and Leave
                     events   for  windows.  Mouse  and  keyboard  events  are
                     directed to the current character. If a virtual event  is
                     used  in  a binding, that binding can trigger only if the
                     virtual event is defined by an  underlying  mouse-related
                     or keyboard-related event.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>cget</B> <I>tagName</I> <I>option</I>
                     named  option  (this list will be identical to the corre-
                     sponding sublist of the value returned if  no  option  is
                     specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are speci-
                     fied, then the command modifies the  given  option(s)  to
                     have the given value(s) in tagName; in this case the com-
                     mand returns an empty string. Note, the  special  -margin
                     option,  if  used, must immediately follow tagName. It is
                     used to create and configure tags used within the  margin
                     area. See "configure options" for more details

              <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>delete</B> <I>tagName</I> <I>?tagName</I> <I>...?</I>
                     Deletes all tag information for each of the tagName argu-
                     ments. The command removes the tags from  all  characters
                     in  the file and also deletes any other information asso-
                     ciated with the tags, such as bindings and display infor-
                     mation. The command returns an empty string.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>lower</B> <I>tagName</I>
                     This  has  NOT  BEEN  IMPLEMENTED  because Scintilla core
                     functionality regarding "markers" (which is how the Scin-
                     tillaTk  tag functionality has been implemented) does not
                     support drawing priority for markers that overlap.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>names</B> <I>?index?</I>
                     Returns a list whose elements are the names  of  all  the
                     tags  that  are active at the character position given by
                     index. If index is omitted, then the  return  value  will
                     describe all of the tags that exist for the widget.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>nextrange</B> <I>tagName</I> <I>index1</I> <I>?index2?</I>
                     This  command searches the text for a range of characters
                     tagged with tagName where  the  first  character  of  the
                     range  is  no earlier than the character at index1 and no
                     later than the character  just  before  index2  (a  range
                     starting at index2 will not be considered). The command's
                     return value is a list containing two elements, which are
                     the  index  of  the  first character of the range and the
                     index of the character just after the  last  one  in  the
                     range.  If  no  matching  range  is found then the return
                     value is an empty string. If index2 is not given then  it
                     defaults to the end of the text.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>prevrange</B> <I>tagName</I> <I>index1</I> <I>?index2?</I>
                     This  command searches the text for a range of characters
                     tagged with tagName where  the  first  character  of  the
                     range  is  before  the character at index1 and no earlier
                     than the character at index2 (a range starting at  index2
                     will be considered). The command's return value is a list
                     containing two elements, which are the index of the first
                     character  of  the  range  and the index of the character
                     just after the last one in  the  range.  If  no  matching
                     range  is found then the return value is an empty string.
                     The first element of each pair contains the index of  the
                     first  character  of the range, and the second element of
                     the pair contains the index of the character  just  after
                     the  last  one  in  the range. If there are no characters
                     tagged with tag then an empty string is returned.

              <I>pathName</I> <B>tag</B> <B>remove</B> <I>tagName</I> <I>index1</I> <I>?index2</I> <I>index1</I> <I>index2</I> <I>...?</I>
                     Remove the tag tagName from all of the characters  start-
                     ing  at index1 and ending just before index2 (the charac-
                     ter at index2 is not affected). A single command may con-
                     tain  any  number  of  index1-index2  pairs.  If the last
                     index2 is omitted then the tag is removed from the single
                     character  at  index1.  If there are no characters in the
                     specified range (e.g. index1 is past the end of the  file
                     or  index2 is less than or equal to index1) then the com-
                     mand has no effect. This command returns an empty string.

       For the above types, use the -foreground configuration option  for  the
       tag to control the color. For types that use a filled interior, use the
       -background option to set the interior color. The following  lists  the
       supported  configuration options, though not all are supported for each
       type of tag (exceptions are noted):

       <B>-background|-bg</B> <I>color</I>
              Color specifies the color used for tags that have a filled inte-
              rior.

       <B>-bold</B> <I>boolean</I> (ONLY FOR MARGIN TAGS)
              Specifies if margins showing text will use a bold font

       <B>-foreground|-fg</B> <I>color</I>
              current version of the widget. The fields of the list are:  ver-
              sion  :  identifies  the Tcl package version date : the date the
              package was created core_rls: this identifies the release of the
              Scintilla core widget

<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Patterns including newline (0 may not work correctly in all cases. This
       limitation is due to how Scintilla stores document  text;  the  end  of
       line  characters are stripped from the document making the search chal-
       lenging.

       The pathName search -regexp sub-command attempts to  perform  sophisti-
       cated  regexp  matching  across multiple lines in an efficient fashion.
       Under certain conditions the  search  result  might  differ  from  that
       obtained by applying the same regexp to the entire text from the widget
       in one go.

       Whenever one possible match is fully enclosed in  another,  the  search
       command  will attempt to ensure only the larger match is returned. When
       performing backwards regexp searches it is possible that Tcl  will  not
       always achieve this.
