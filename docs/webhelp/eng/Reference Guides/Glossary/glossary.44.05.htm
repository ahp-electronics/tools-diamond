The effort level settings are: 1) High, which provides the highest quality placement but requires the longest execution time. Use high effort on designs that do not route or do not meet your performance requirements. 2) Normal, which is the default effort level. It provides the best trade-off between execution time and high-quality placement for most designs. 3) Low, which provides a lower-quality placement but requires the shortest execution time.</p><h5 id="ww1188350" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>electromigration</h5><p id="ww1188351" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Electromigration is the erosion of a metal conductor by the flow of electrons in an integrated circuit because of Joule heating and high current density.</p><h5 id="ww1188352" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>Electronic Design Interchange Format </h5><p id="ww1188356" class="GlossDef"><span></span>See <a href="../../Reference%20Guides/Glossary/glossary.44.05.htm#ww1188339" title="E">EDIF</a>.</p><h5 id="ww1188358" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>.elf</h5><p id="ww1188359" class="GlossDef"><span></span>An .elf file is a file in executable linked format that contains the software application code written in C/C++ SPE.</p><h5 id="ww1188360" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>embedded block RAM</h5><p id="ww1188361" class="GlossDef"><span></span>An embedded block RAM is a RAM cell in an FPGA that can be configured for RAM, ROM, FIFO, CAMs, and so forth.</p><h5 id="ww1188362" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>EPIC</h5><p id="ww1188363" class="GlossDef"><span></span>EPIC is an acronym for Editor for Programmable ICs, which is a Lattice Diamond stand-alone application for displaying and configuring FPGAs.
