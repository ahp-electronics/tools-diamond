Before implementation, logic path delays are only estimated. The actual wiring delays (that is, the parasitic resistance and capacitance) cannot be known until after placement and routing has been performed. Back annotation substitutes the actual delays for the estimated delays in the netlist.</p><h5 id="ww1187969" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>backplane</h5><p id="ww1187970" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A backplane is a circuit board containing circuitry and sockets into which additional electronic devices on other circuits boards or cards can be plugged.</p><h5 id="ww1187971" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>bank</h5><p id="ww1187972" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A bank is an arrangement of identical hardware components that are electrically connected, such as I/O pads.</p><h5 id="ww1187973" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>behavioral design</h5><p id="ww1187974" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Behavioral design is a technology-independent, text-based design that incorporates high-level functionality and a high-level information flow.</p><h5 id="ww1187975" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>behavioral design method</h5><p id="ww1187976" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A behavioral design method is a method of defining a circuit in terms of a textual language rather than a schematic of interconnected symbols.</p><h5 id="ww1187977" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>behavioral simulation</h5><p id="ww1187978" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Behavioral simulation is the same as functional simulation.

It is equivalent to the Bitstream File process in Lattice Diamond’s Process view. The program takes a fully routed physical design, in the form of a circuit description (.ncd) file as input and produces a configuration bitstream (bit images).</p><h5 id="ww1188017" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>bitstream</h5><p id="ww1188018" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A bitstream is a sequence of binary data that contains the configuration information from the physical design defining the internal logic and interconnections of the FPGA, as well as device-specific information from other files associated with the target device. When downloaded to a device, a bitstream configures the logic and programs the device so that the states of that device can be read back.</p><h5 id="ww1188024" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>block</h5><p id="ww1188025" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A block is a symbol that represents lower-level circuitry; for example, a group of one or more logic functions or a schematic or symbol sheet. A block does not show any details of the circuitry, except for I/O pins. Blocks are most often used to simplify a complex schematic or to allow a large schematic to fit on a single sheet. Blocks usually represent repeated sections of circuitry but can replace any part of a schematic. As a representation of a schematic or symbol sheet, there are four types of blocks: 1) A composite block indicates that the design is hierarchical. 2) A module block is a symbol with no underlying schematic. 3) A pin block represents a schematic pin. 4) An annotate block is a symbol without electrical connectivity that is used only for documentation and graphics.</p><h5 id="ww1188026" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>block check</h5><p id="ww1188027" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A block check is a physical DRC check in the EPIC software that examines one or more placed or unplaced components and reports any problems with logic, physical pin connections, or programming. It can be performed on selected components or on all components in the design. When you check all components in the design, the block check performs extra tests on the design as a whole (for example, tristate buffers sharing long lines and oscillator circuitry configured correctly) in addition to checking the individual components. You can run the block check separately or with the net check.</p><h5 id="ww1188028" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>block modular design</h5><p id="ww1188029" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Block modular design is a design strategy that allows multiple designers to work on parts, or “block modules,” of a single design independently. It also enables a single designer to make incremental changes with minimal impact to other portions of the design.</p><h5 id="ww1188030" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>block symbol</h5><p id="ww1188031" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A block symbol is a schematic symbol that represents a schematic or HDL module at the next-lower level of hierarchy.</p><h5 id="ww1188033" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>boundary scan</h5><p id="ww1188034" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Boundary scan is a method of testing electronic assemblies at the board level by inserting registers and control logic to serially scan in test patterns and scan output data registers. The primary objectives are the testing of chip I/O signals and the interconnections between ICs. It is the method for observing and controlling all new chip I/O signals through a standard interface called a test access port (TAP). The boundary scan architecture includes four dedicated I/O pins for control and is described in IEEE spec 1149.1.</p><h5 id="ww1188035" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>breakpoints</h5><p id="ww1188036" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Breakpoints are a combination of signal states that are used to indicate when simulation should stop. They enable you to stop a program at certain points to examine the current state and the test environment to determine whether the program functions as expected.</p><h5 id="ww1188042" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>BS</h5><p id="ww1188046" class="GlossDef"><span></span>See <a href="../../Reference%20Guides/Glossary/glossary.44.02.htm#ww1188033" title="B">boundary scan</a>.</p><h5 id="ww1188047" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>BSCAN</h5><p id="ww1188051" class="GlossDef"><span></span>See <a href="../../Reference%20Guides/Glossary/glossary.44.02.htm#ww1188033" title="B">boundary scan</a>.</p><h5 id="ww1188052" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>BSDL</h5><p id="ww1188053" class="GlossDef"><span></span>BSDL is an abbreviation for Boundary Scan Description Language, which is an IEEE language used to describe the structures for boundary scan testing.</p><h5 id="ww1188054" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>buffer</h5><p id="ww1188055" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A buffer is an isolation circuit used to insulate sensitive analog or digital circuits from higher power levels or higher current levels in other portions of the chip.</p><h5 id="ww1188056" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>burst mode</h5><p id="ww1188057" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Burst mode is a type of high-speed data transmission in which multiple transfers of data take place between a master and a slave within the same bus transaction.</p><h5 id="ww1188058" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>bus</h5><p id="ww1188059" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A bus is a named collection of two or more wires or other buses that carry closely associated signals in an electronic design. Attaching a bus tap to a single wire “promotes” the wire to a bus. In a schematic, a bus looks like a single wire but is displayed in a different color. (The color does not appear until you name the bus.) The individual signals within a bus can be tapped off at any point along the bus, as often as needed. (Schematic Editor does not check to see if you are overloading the bus.)</p><h5 id="ww1188060" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>bus pin</h5><p id="ww1188061" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A bus pin is a pin used to connect a bus to a symbol.</p><h5 id="ww1188062" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>bus tap</h5><p id="ww1188063" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A bus tap is the point at which a signal enters or exits a bus.</p></div><div id="page_dates"><div class="ww_skin_page_publish_date"></div></div><!-- Related Topics --><!--                --><footer><!-- Disqus --><!--        --><!-- Google Translation --><!--                    --><br /></footer></div></div><noscript><div id="noscript_warning">This site works best with JavaScript enabled</div></noscript></body></html>
