TRACE performs two major functions: 1) Timing verification, which is the process of verifying that the design meets your timing preferences 2) Reporting, which is the process of enumerating input preference violations and placing them into an accessible file. TRACE can be run on completely placed and routed designs or on designs that are placed and/or routed to any degree of completion. The report issued by TRACE depends on the completeness of the placement and routing of the input design.
