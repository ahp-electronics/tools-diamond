It is one of two types of filters used in digital signal processing. The IIR (infinite impulse response) filter is the other. FIR filters are used more frequently than IIR filters because they are stable; require no feedback; can be designed to be linear phase filters, which delay the input signal but do not distort its phase; and are simple to implement. However, FIR filters are less efficient than IIR filters.</p><h5 id="ww1188423" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>flash memory</h5><p id="ww1188424" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Flash memory is a type of programmable chip that retains data even when the power is turned off.</p><h5 id="ww1188425" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>flat design</h5><p id="ww1188426" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A flat design is a design composed of multiple sheets at the top-level schematic.</p><h5 id="ww1188427" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>flattening</h5><p id="ww1188428" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Flattening is the process of resolving all the hierarchy references in a design.

A flattened design still contains hierarchical names for instances and nets.</p><h5 id="ww1188429" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>flip chip</h5><p id="ww1188430" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A flip chip is a surface mount chip technology in which the chip is packaged in place on the board and then underfilled with an epoxy. A common technique for attachment is to place solder balls on the chip, “flip” the chip over onto the board, and melt the solder.</p><h5 id="ww1188431" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>flip-flop</h5><p id="ww1188432" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A flip-flop is a simple two-state logic buffer activated by a clock and fed by a single input working in combination with the clock. The states are high and low. When the clock goes high, the flip-flop works as a buffer as it outputs the value of the D input at the time the clock rises. The value is kept until the next clock cycle (rising clock edge). The output is not affected when the clock goes low (falling clock edge).</p><h5 id="ww1188433" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>Floorplan View</h5><p id="ww1188434" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Floorplan View is a view in the Diamond that provides a convenient large-component layout of your design. It shows placement and routing and provides toolbar and menu commands for displaying UGROUPS and REGIONs, utilized and reserved resources, and connections. Floorplan View allows you to create REGIONs and bounding boxes for UGROUPs, and reserve resources on the layout.</p><h5 id="ww1188440" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>floorplanning</h5><p id="ww1188441" class="GlossDef"><span></span>Floorplanning is the process of choosing the best grouping and connectivity of logic in a design.

Because timing information for the design is not available, the simulator tests the logic in the design using unit delays. Functional simulation is usually performed on designs that are entered using a hardware definition language (HDL). It is usually performed at the pre-synthesis stage of the design process. Functional simulation verifies that the HDL code describes the desired design behavior.</p><h5 id="ww1188466" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>fuse</h5><p id="ww1188467" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A fuse, or fusible link, is a metal wire or strip that melts when a current reaches a specified temperature, opening the circuit in which it is embedded to protect the circuit from an overcurrent condition.</p><h5 id="ww1188468" class="GlossTerm"><span></span>fuse map</h5><p id="ww1188469" class="GlossDef"><span></span>A fuse nap is a design file in which the fuse data is already prearranged in exactly the same format as the physical layout of the fuse array of the device.</p></div><div id="page_dates"><div class="ww_skin_page_publish_date"></div></div><!-- Related Topics --><!--                --><footer><!-- Disqus --><!--        --><!-- Google Translation --><!--                    --><br /></footer></div></div><noscript><div id="noscript_warning">This site works best with JavaScript enabled</div></noscript></body></html>
