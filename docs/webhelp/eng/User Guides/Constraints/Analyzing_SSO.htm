When multiple output drivers change state at the same time, the changing current in the power system induces a voltage that results in power supply disturbances. These disturbances, or noise, can cause undesired transient behavior among output drivers, input receivers, or internal logic. Analysis of simultaneous switching outputs helps ensure that your I/O plan meets the I/O standards and power integrity requirements of the PCB design.</p><h5 id="ww1084287" class="HeadingRunIn"><span></span>SSO Calculator</h5><p id="ww1084288" class="Body"><span></span>The SSO calculator estimates Simultaneous Switching Noise (SSN) affecting a victim pin according to the switching characteristics of aggressor pins. It does this either on a victim-pin-by-victim-pin basis (Pin Analysis) or on the basis of the worst-case victim pin placement in each bank (Bank Analysis). In many cases, adjusting the location of aggressor pins relative to victims can help mitigate noisy conditions. Noise is characterized by the calculator as ground bounce or voltage drop depending on the type of analysis run. The calculator will produce worst-case bank-based ground bounce results for those banks that have partial signal assignments, and it will produce a more accurate pin-based ground bounce and voltage drop results if all signals of a bank are assigned.</p><p id="ww1084289" class="Body"><span></span>The following calculation is made for a victim pin (in Bank-based Analysis, the worst case victim is used for each bank):</p><p id="ww1084290" class="Body"><span></span>Pass/Fail status: Fails if (Total Noise) &gt; (Pass/Fail criteria) * ALLOWANCE</p><p id="ww1084291" class="Body"><span></span>where:</p><p id="ww1084292" class="Body"><span></span>Total Noise (mV) = Board Noise + Device Noise</p><p id="ww1084293" class="Body"><span></span>Board PCB Noise can be on the ground plane, for ground bounce calculations; or it can be on the power plane, for Vcc drop calculations. PCB estimated ground plane noise is entered as +X mV. PCB estimated power plane noise is entered as -X mV.</p><p id="ww1084294" class="Body"><span></span>Device noise is the maximum noise imposed on a victim pin by each of the aggressor pin groups. Aggressor groups are specified by using SwitchingID assignments. Reports show which aggressor group is causing the most noise on a victim.</p><p id="ww1084295" class="Body"><span></span>The Pass/Fail criteria is based on the IO_TYPE of the victim. SSO allowance is a user override that adjusts the pass/fail criteria, where default is no change to the pass/fail criteria (100%)</p><h5 id="ww1084296" class="HeadingRunIn"><span></span>SSN Accuracy</h5><p id="ww1084297" class="Body"><span></span>SSO calculator estimations are based off of hardware data collected during characterization. The measurements were taken using Lattice test PC boards with signal loading on individual banks. Because the total SSN is a function of PCB ground and board inductance, care must be given to apply accurate SSO preferences based on the parasitic inductances of your system environment.</p><h5 id="ww1084298" class="HeadingRunIn"><span></span>About Pin-Based Analysis Reports</h5><p id="ww1084299" class="Body"><span></span>Pin-based analysis produces estimates for ground bounce and voltage drop SSN per pin. Pin-based analysis is performed after design signals have been assigned to pins. These pin assignments can be made by setting preferences or by placing and routing the design. The analysis calculates the noise that each pin, as a victim, experiences. It reports the pass/fail status of each pin and where the noise originates—the aggressor group identified by SwitchingID. </p><h5 id="ww1084300" class="HeadingRunIn"><span></span>About Bank-Based Analysis Reports</h5><p id="ww1084301" class="Body"><span></span>Bank-based analysis produces ground bounce SSN per bank. When at least one signal is assigned only to a bank and not to a pin, bank-based calculation is performed. Compared to pin-based analysis, bank-based analysis assumes worst case placement in the bank for the victim and set of aggressors. Any placement information that does exist is ignored, and worst-case placement is used.</p><p id="ww1084302" class="Body"><span></span>For both Pin-based and Bank-based analysis, pins or banks programmed for signal standards (IO_TYPE) other than those that the calculator supports are ignored.</p><h5 id="ww1084303" class="HeadingRunIn"><span></span>Addressing SSN Problems</h5><p id="ww1084304" class="Body"><span></span>The SSO calculator is a good tool for confirming the quality of an I/O plan. After legal signal assignments have been verified and placed using the I/O Assistant strategy, use the SSO calculator to adjust relative placement where SSN margins are exceeded.</p><p id="ww1084305" class="Body"><span></span>The following adjustments to your I/O plan can help avoid SSN problems:</p><div id="ww1084306" class="Bulleted"><span class="WebWorks_Number" style="width: 16.56pt"><span><img src="../square.png" alt="*" border="0" width="7" height="7" /></span></span>Spread aggressors away from victim pins.
