Design Errors/Warnings
----------------------

WARNING - map: Using local reset signal 'rstn_c' to infer global GSR net.
WARNING - map: The reset of EBR 'counter_top_reveal_coretop_instance/counter_top
     _la0_inst_0/trig_u/te_0/genblk1.te_tt_ebr_ram/pmi_ram_dpXbnonesadr112112p12
     e1ac7f_0_0_0' cannot be controlled. The local reset is not connected to any
     control signal and set to GND. The global reset is disabled via GSR
     property. To control the EBR reset, either connect the local reset to a
     control signal or force the GSR property to be enabled.

Memory Usage
------------

    
         
    INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC Reset Mode that has a limitation:
    The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing
    be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block. 
    See the device specific data sheet for additional details.

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'rstn_c' of the design has been inferred as Global Set
        Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'rstn_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
