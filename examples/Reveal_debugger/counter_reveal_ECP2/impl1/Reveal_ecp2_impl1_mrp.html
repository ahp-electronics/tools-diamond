    INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC Reset Mode that has a limitation:
    The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing
    be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block. 
    See the device specific data sheet for additional details.

---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'rstn_c' of the design has been inferred as Global Set
        Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'rstn_c'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
