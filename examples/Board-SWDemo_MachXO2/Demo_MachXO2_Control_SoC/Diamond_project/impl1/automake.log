    TIME_INST/sec_clock (driver: TIME_INST/SLICE_208, clk load #: 13)


The following 3 signals are selected to use the secondary clock routing resources:

WARNING - par: Signal "rst_n_c" is selected to use Secondary clock resources; however its driver comp "rst_n" is located at "K2", which is not a dedicated pin for connecting to Secondary clock resources.  General routing has to be used to route this signal, and it may suffer from excessive delay or skew.
Signal wb_rst is selected as Global Set/Reset.
